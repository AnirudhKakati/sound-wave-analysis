Also cat was moving and she rarely meows so having the mic close to her without wind or handling noise was complicated.\nProcessing : Trimmed, in audacity 3.4.2. Significantly denoised and EQed the lows out.\nTips :\n\nAttribution is greatly appreciated but not required.

Then it shows some occasional sounds of mating and catterwall sound. A recording of the actual birthing process could not be taken as it wasn't known where the queen was going to deliver her litter. She was almost one year old when she had them.\nLike the other recordings in this sound pack, the mother cat and her kittens are inside a nesting box in the garage. A small stereo microphone (Olympus ME51s) was placed inside the brooding area. After editing, they were exported to MP3 format.\nSounds include mewing, purring, shuffling, nursing, and mother cat eating dry kibble. Some occasional heartbeats may be heard as the mother cat or kittens move inside. Other sounds include a rooster crowing, and people working outside, and some occasional people talking in the background.\nAt this stage, the kittens are in week 2 of their life.",

While a dove was putting the finishing touch to her nest. The microphones were clipped on the side wall of the balcony, about 20cm under the nest. \nHere, the dove is coming. First, she goes to the metallic fences of the balcony, then comes to her nest, makes some small adjustments, before keeping almost silent. In the background, seagulls, other doves, some birds chirping, a moped passing by in the distance, a cat meowing and an airplane flying over. \nRecorded in May 2023 with an Olympus LS-P4 and Micbooster Clippy Stereo EM272 microphones (Primo em272). \nFade in/out and high pass filter at 30Hz -6dB/oct applied in Audacity. \n(If you want to use this sound as a mono audio file, you may have to delete one channel to avoid phase issues).",
