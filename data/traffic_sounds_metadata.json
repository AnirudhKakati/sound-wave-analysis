        "description": "This is a sound of crickets singing on a summernight in a town or in the suburbs. It's not directly recorded, but made of different sounds. I tried to make a realistic Hollywood night sound with crickets as they really sound in Southern California. So I found an easy on-line field guide of cricket species of the US. Then I checked some different common cricket species and saw a map of where they occur. Then I found out that this site, also had real recordings of those crickets occurring in Southern California or elsewhere. So I downloaded the right species and mixed them together and added a bit of background traffic and wind, and even a dog barking for more realism. It was actually really easy!!! So the result is a sound of the real cricket species that live in California. Perfect for hollywood films where night scenes are included!!! ALSO: When you use this for a film, soundtrack or something, I would very much like to see/hear it. Write a comment with a link here!Enjoy!!! :D I encourage you not to use this sound in projects and sounds that maybe are going to be sold due to copyright issues that could occur by doing so. ",

The recorder was moved as it recorded closer to the wet road at the edge of the park. In general, five successful takes out of five were made, from distances of 200, 100, 50, 25, 5 meters (approximately). This is recording from a distance 5m.\nRecorded November 14, 2023 on Tascam DR-05x, with post processing.\nSee recordings from other distances in the folder Ambience.Traffic <a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/packs/34346/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/packs/34346/</a>\nSee more field recordings in folders:\nAmbience.Misc <a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/packs/34344/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/packs/34344/</a>\nAmbience.Park <a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/packs/33114/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/packs/33114/</a>\nAmbience.Birdsong <a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/packs/38584/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/packs/38584/</a>\nAmbience.Forest <a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/packs/35656/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/packs/35656/</a>\nAmbience.Grassland <a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/packs/35654/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/packs/35654/</a>\nBirds <a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/packs/33110/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/packs/33110/</a>",

The recorder was moved as it recorded closer to the wet road at the edge of the park. In general, five successful takes out of five were made, from distances of 200, 100, 50, 25, 5 meters (approximately). This is recording from a distance 100m. \nRecorded November 14, 2023 on Tascam DR-05x, with post processing.\nSee recordings from other distances in the folder Ambience.Traffic <a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/packs/34346/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/packs/34346/</a>\nSee more field recordings in folders:\nAmbience.Misc <a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/packs/34344/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/packs/34344/</a>\nAmbience.Park <a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/packs/33114/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/packs/33114/</a>\nAmbience.Birdsong <a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/packs/38584/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/packs/38584/</a>\nAmbience.Forest <a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/packs/35656/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/packs/35656/</a>\nAmbience.Grassland <a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/packs/35654/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/packs/35654/</a>\nBirds <a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/packs/33110/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/packs/33110/</a>",

        "description": "This was a small series of sound recordings, the purpose of which was to capture pure calm traffic, from various distances and without accompanying activity (voices, pedestrians, dogs, etc.) It was recorded in a warm late autumn, in a quiet, evening park, in damp weather. The recorder was moved as it recorded closer to the wet road at the edge of the park. In general, five successful takes out of five were made, from distances of 200, 100, 50, 25, 5 meters (approximately). This is recording from a distance 50m.\nRecorded November 14, 2023 on Tascam DR-05x, with post processing.\nSee recordings from other distances in the folder Ambience.Traffic <a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/packs/34346/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/packs/34346/</a>\nSee more field recordings in folders:\nAmbience.Misc <a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/packs/34344/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/packs/34344/</a>\nAmbience.Park <a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/packs/33114/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/packs/33114/</a>\nAmbience.Birdsong <a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/packs/38584/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/packs/38584/</a>\nAmbience.Forest <a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/packs/35656/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/packs/35656/</a>\nAmbience.Grassland <a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/packs/35654/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/packs/35654/</a>\nBirds <a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/packs/33110/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/packs/33110/</a>",

The three samples in this series were recorded simultaneously (from approximately the same position) with three different standard stereo microphone arrangements: mid-side (mixed into L-R), X-Y cardioid, andwith a Jecklin disk.  The 2'40\" recordings capture automobile traffic passing from right to left and left to right directly in front of the microphone on a country road in New Jersey (USA) on September 9, 2006.  There is considerable ambient sound audible, mostly from a proliferation of crickets.  This recording was made with a pair of Audio-Technica AT-3032 omni-directional microphones (with Rycote \"ball gag\" windscreens) mounted on a Jecklin disk and connected to a Sound Devices 744T digital recorder at 96K/24bits.",

Everything around is covered with snow, which absorbs all sounds very well. Right in front of us, 200m away, there is a road with leisurely traffic. Behind the road, 350-400 meters away, you can hear the noise of a construction site and hammer blows, which are reflected from nearby buildings. To the sides and straight ahead we hear the distant voices of passers-by.\nRecorded in park, named after the 50th anniversary of the All-Union Lenin Communist Youth Union in the city of Ekaterinburg (Russia)\nRecorded January , 2024 on Tascam DR-05x, with post processing.",

For a digitally generated recreation, go to <a href=\"https://freesound.org/s/474366/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://freesound.org/s/474366/</a>.\n\n***\n\nNew Zealand uses \u2018Audible Tactile Traffic Signals\u2019 at almost all of their light-controlled pedestrian crossings to aid visual- and hearing-impaired pedestrians, letting them know when the pedestrian light is green and it\u2019s safe to cross.\n\nThere are two parts to the audible component: the locating signal and the crossing signal.\n\nThe locating signal assists vision-impaired people in finding the pedestrian push-button. This \u201cconsists of a short pip (25\u00a0ms of 1000\u00a0Hz square wave) repeating every 1.8\u00a0seconds.\u201d (NZTA Road Traffic Standards)\n\nThe crossing signal indicates that the pedestrian crossing signal is green and that the pedestrians may cross. This consists of a square wave which \u201cdescends exponentially in pitch from 3,500\u00a0Hz to 700\u00a0Hz over 115\u00a0ms. This is immediately followed by a rapidly pulsing sinusoidal 500\u00a0Hz signal that decays over 35\u00a0ms, before ceasing momentarily and being repeated at 8.5\u00a0times a second for the duration of the cross signal.\u201d (NZTA Road Traffic Standards)\n\nThe volume of the audible signal responds to ambient sound levels. i.e.\u00a0When nearby traffic is louder, the signal is louder, but when the environment is quiet, signal noise is lowered accordingly.\n\nRecorded with a Zoom H4n Pro in Auckland, New Zealand.",

Pigeons are walking and cooing around and footsteps of passers-by can be heard climbing the rocky path.\nRecorded May 15 , 2024 on Tascam DR-05x, with post processing.\nLocation: Ekaterinburg City (Russia).

        "description": "Nature is rebelling against man. Abnormal weather in our region. Wet snow fell yesterday (100 mm). Trees are breaking under his weight. The temperature then drops below 0 Degrees Celsius, then rises to +20C.  The snow melts and immediately freezes, turning sidewalks and roads into a crunchy ice rink. Sound recording of city noise in an alley in the dark late at night, around midnight. The background noise of traffic is cut by distant passing cars. Meltwater drips from the roof of the nearest building. Infrequent bell strikes are faintly heard, on the eve of the Orthodox Easter holiday. People pass by with their pets. One of the pets saw me from afar and started barking warningly. Cars drive through the alley on dirty snowmelt and water. It's Sunday, May 05, I'm sitting and writing all this, and it's snowing again outside the window.\nRecorded May 04 , 2024 on Tascam DR-05x, with post processing.\nLocation: Ekaterinburg City (Russia)\nI ask you, if possible, to help this wonderful site (not me) stay afloat and develop further.

My first impression is that the setup sounds quite warm and detailed. It captures the \"feel\" of the environment and adds its classic warm low energy. Maybe its just me but i perceive the setup to be somewhat unbalanced in its stereo image but not too much.\n\nFun test but I prefer using DPA (2011) in AB or ORTF because it captures a great deal of detail and yet balances it out with the low and highs.\n\nThere's a similar recording of the same place and setup in my profile \"Amb_Swed_City_Square_Traffic_Bus_2\". It's less active and more general, good for a more consistent and mellow background.\n\nHope it comes to some use for you!",

My first impression is that the setup sounds quite warm and detailed. It captures the \"feel\" of the environment and adds its classic warm low energy. Maybe its just me but i perceive the setup to be somewhat unbalanced in its stereo image but not too much.\n\nFun test but I prefer using DPA (2011) in AB or ORTF because it captures a great deal of detail and yet balances it out with the low and highs.\n\nThere's a similar recording of the same place and setup in my profile \"Amb_Swed_City_Square_Traffic_Bus_1\". It has more activity and life.\n\n\nHope it comes to some use for you!",

        "description": "Morning Zoom H1n recording of rain around 9am, city atmosphere. \n\nPrevious I used an upside down broken cloths basket lined at the top with a plastic garbage can liner to catch the sound of snow falling a few weeks ago. Strangely enough spring like weather hit us in Michigan during the middle of our snow season, so we've had a lot of rain lately. I figured I'd try the same set-up I used for recording snow, but for rain instead. It was also trash day in our subdivision so you might hear some distant garbage trucks and the usual traffic hum of the Motor City ( The nick name for Detroit, MI). The rain hitting the plastic liner about 3 inches above the mic, sort of sounds like a crackling from a fire to me, which I thought was kind of cool.\n\nBesides editing out the beginning and end of the track, it's uncut. Not sure if I'll use it on my YouTube Channel, but you're more then welcomed to use it how you see fit.

        "description": "I recently contributed a track to a Triple LP set of krautrock cover versions (\"Head Music 2\", released by Fruits De Mer Records, December 2020). The song I chose to cover was Kraftwerk's \"Autobahn\".\n\nIf you know the track, you'll know that it uses synthesised traffic sounds alongside recordings of the same. On my version, I achieved these in three ways:\n\n1) I downloaded some public domain traffic sound effects from elsewhere here on <a href=\"http://freesound.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">freesound.org</a> (thanks, guys!)\n\n2) I got in my car with my Zoom recorder and made my own recordings of the engine starting, stopping, etc\n\n3) I made my own sound effects using virtual synths and effects in Ableton Live 10\n\nThis particular sound falls into the third category.\n\nLet me stress that while the song \"Autobahn\" is copyrighted, these are isolated sound effects and are not covered by copyright. I'm making them available here under a public domain licence. \n\nIf you download and use any of these  samples, please let me know in the comments what you did with them. It's not compulsory but it would be interesting to know what people did with these sounds.",

        "description": "Traffic in Paris (binaural, please use headset for 3D effects). \nI made this recording during a warm autumn morning, just near a stoplight  bordering the crossing of several cobbled streets, in the surroundings of Cambronne metro station, in Paris (France). \nOne can hear different vehicles (cars, motorcycles, mopeds, buses, trucks, as well as bicycles) passing by in the streets, honking at times, while some people are walking and chatting on the sidewalk. In the background, hum from the city, and sometimes, squeaking noise from the brakes of the metro stopping in the nearby outdoor subway station. Quite a typical Parisian atmosphere, in my opinion. \nRecorded in October 2023 with an Olympus LS-P4 and Ohrwurm 3D binaural microphones. \nFade in/out and high pass filter at 60Hz -6dB/oct applied in Audacity. \n(If you want to use this sound as a mono audio file, you may have to delete one channel to avoid phase issues).",

Small waves beat against the walls of the bridge supports and pavement, and the sound reflected from the concrete arches is drowned in beautiful echoes. You can also hear a knock from the wheels of cars passing along the joints, which is also colored by reflections. Twice, old heavy trams roar past, resembling a passing airliner more than a tram.\nRecorded 28 September, 2023 on Tascam DR-05x, with post processing\nLocation: The so-called \"Makarovsky Bridge\" across the river \"Iset\" is in the city of Ekaterinburg, Russia.\nSee more field recordings in folders:\nAmbience.Misc <a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/packs/34344/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/packs/34344/</a>\nAmbience.Park <a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/packs/33114/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/packs/33114/</a>\nAmbience.Birdsong <a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/packs/38584/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/packs/38584/</a>\nAmbience.Forest <a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/packs/35656/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/packs/35656/</a>\nAmbience.Grassland <a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/packs/35654/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/packs/35654/</a>\nBirds <a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/packs/33110/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/packs/33110/</a>\n<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/ZmQmB3z/20230928-113530.jpg\">\n<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/yRdM6dW/20230928-113548.jpg\">\n<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/CBC8txQ/20230928-115219.jpg\">",

Throughout this entire recording, you'll hear the everpresent hum of heating and air conditioner units running.  You will also hear faint conversations and laughter of students as they walk to class, faint sounds from a nearby construction site, distant rumble of traffic, the distant droning of an airplane lazily floating through the April sky.  \r\n     From time to time you will also hear the well known \"beep...beep.....beep....\" of a piece of heavy equipment backing up.\r\n\r\n   However, despite all of the dominating background of man and his machines, nature comes through.  Since \r\nI was sitting on the edge of a fairly large woods which sits in the center of all of the concrete and glass and steel, the sweet singing of birds lasts throughout much of this recording.\r\n\r\nEquipment used:  Zoom  H4N recorder using the INTERNAL stereo microphones set on 180 degrees for the greatest sound capture.",

The site is just east of Mattoon, Illinois in Coles County, USA. This location is significant because of its tallgrass prairie and woodland habitats that provide sanctuary for a variety of native Illinois flora and fauna. The recording was done on a handheld stereo digital recorder with bidirectional microphones (the make and model is Zoom H1n). A handmade wind buffer of furry cloth was used over the microphones and secured with soft elastic. This recording took place on Monday, November 14, 2022 at approximately 1:30 p.m. The weather was clear, sunny, and 41 degrees Fahrenheit with occasional winds of 7 miles per hour. The sounds include rubber boots walking on gravel, walking on dry and wet leaves, walking on snow and ice, walking over wooden bridges, a walking stick meeting the ground, bird calls, traffic along adjacent highways Dewitt Avenue and Lerna Road, faraway sounds from a cement plant, wind blowing through the tree limbs, wind rustling through the prairie grasses, walking on soggy earth, a worker at the nature center using an electric hand drill, walking on pavement, a car door opening and closing, sniffling...",
