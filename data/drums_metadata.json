It is interesting to see how much variety can originate from a single source. This sample, as well as this pack in general is a testament to that. You have a simple drum beat, and then, I apply various effects then I iterate and continue ad nauseam.\n\nFor those who may care about the naming convention: each type of effect is labelled as FX###, and then each variation of parameters within that same effect is labelled by a following v###. Furthermore, if I decide to get ambitious I may iterated the same exact effect with the same parameters again (and again...), I indicate the number of iterations in the name of the track as well. And when I get super ambitious I may chain together effects, and then I indicate the \"infra-effect\" with an additional v### to indicate that I'm applying different effects to a single instance of a particular effect.\n\nAnyway, enough of the monotonous stuff.\n\nI hope you enjoy this stuff, I hope you can use it in your own work and that perhaps it sparks something in your mind about the power of iteration, change, and the unity that lies under the diverse manifestation of sound.\n\nAll I ask is that if you do use any of this in your work at all, to cite me as the origin of the samples, you can cite me, Hewn.Marrow by linking <a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/Hewn.Marrow/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://freesound.org/people/Hewn.Marrow/</a>.\n\nSecondarily, the audio samples may not be used in stock material.

You have a simple drum beat, and then, I apply various effects then I iterate and continue ad nauseam.\n\nFor those who may care about the naming convention: each type of effect is labelled as FX###, and then each variation of parameters within that same effect is labelled by a following v###. Furthermore, if I decide to get ambitious I may iterated the same exact effect with the same parameters again (and again...), I indicate the number of iterations in the name of the track as well. And when I get super ambitious I may chain together effects, and then I indicate the \"infra-effect\" with an additional v### to indicate that I'm applying different effects to a single instance of a particular effect.\n\nAnyway, enough of the monotonous stuff.\n\nI hope you enjoy this stuff, I hope you can use it in your own work and that perhaps it sparks something in your mind about the power of iteration, change, and the unity that lies under the diverse manifestation of sound.\n\nAll I ask is that if you do use any of this in your work at all, to cite me as the origin of the samples, you can cite me, Hewn.Marrow by linking <a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/Hewn.Marrow/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://freesound.org/people/Hewn.Marrow/</a>.\n\nSecondarily, the audio samples may not be used in stock material.

        "description": "I generated a simple beat in FL Studio 21 using FPC (a drumkit that comes with FL Studio). I used the Funk HQ drum pack samples.\n\nThe beat is played at 160 BPM and I have presented to you the clean (unedited version) and then I have used Audacity to add effects.\n\nEach effect has multiple tweaked versions and I labelled these tracks accordingly.\nAs with all the tracks, feel free to use them, manipulate them, do whatever you wish to them for any projects you may have. I just ask that you provide credit and attribution by providing a link and citing me, Hewn.Marrow as the original creator of the sample. For attribution purposes, use the following link: <a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/Hewn.Marrow/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://freesound.org/people/Hewn.Marrow/</a>\n\nThank you and enjoy.",

And when I get super ambitious I may chain together effects, and then I indicate the \"infra-effect\" with an additional v### to indicate that I'm applying different effects to a single instance of a particular effect.\n\nAnyway, enough of the monotonous stuff.\n\nI hope you enjoy this stuff, I hope you can use it in your own work and that perhaps it sparks something in your mind about the power of iteration, change, and the unity that lies under the diverse manifestation of sound.\n\nAll I ask is that if you do use any of this in your work at all, to cite me as the origin of the samples, you can cite me, Hewn.Marrow by linking <a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/Hewn.Marrow/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://freesound.org/people/Hewn.Marrow/</a>.\n\nSecondarily, the audio samples may not be used in stock material.

You have a simple drum beat, and then, I apply various effects then I iterate and continue ad nauseam.\n\nFor those who may care about the naming convention: each type of effect is labelled as FX###, and then each variation of parameters within that same effect is labelled by a following v###. Furthermore, if I decide to get ambitious I may iterated the same exact effect with the same parameters again (and again...), I indicate the number of iterations in the name of the track as well. And when I get super ambitious I may chain together effects, and then I indicate the \"infra-effect\" with an additional v### to indicate that I'm applying different effects to a single instance of a particular effect.\n\nAnyway, enough of the monotonous stuff.\n\nI hope you enjoy this stuff, I hope you can use it in your own work and that perhaps it sparks something in your mind about the power of iteration, change, and the unity that lies under the diverse manifestation of sound.\n\nAll I ask is that if you do use any of this in your work at all, to cite me as the origin of the samples, you can cite me, Hewn.Marrow by linking <a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/Hewn.Marrow/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://freesound.org/people/Hewn.Marrow/</a>.\n\nSecondarily, the audio samples may not be used in stock material.

Furthermore, if I decide to get ambitious I may iterated the same exact effect with the same parameters again (and again...), I indicate the number of iterations in the name of the track as well.

        "description": "I've been obsessed with iteration. More than that, I've been fixated on taking a single idea, and then applying as many permutations as I can to it. It is interesting to see how much variety can originate from a single source. This sample, as well as this pack in general is a testament to that. You have a simple drum beat, and then, I apply various effects then I iterate and continue ad nauseam.\n\nFor those who may care about the naming convention: each type of effect is labelled as FX###, and then each variation of parameters within that same effect is labelled by a following v###. Furthermore, if I decide to get ambitious I may iterated the same exact effect with the same parameters again (and again...), I indicate the number of iterations in the name of the track as well. And when I get super ambitious I may chain together effects, and then I indicate the \"infra-effect\" with an additional v### to indicate that I'm applying different effects to a single instance of a particular effect.\n\nAnyway, enough of the monotonous stuff.\n\nI hope you enjoy this stuff, I hope you can use it in your own work and that perhaps it sparks something in your mind about the power of iteration, change, and the unity that lies under the diverse manifestation of sound.\n\nAll I ask is that if you do use any of this in your work at all, to cite me as the origin of the samples, you can cite me, Hewn.Marrow by linking <a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/Hewn.Marrow/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://freesound.org/people/Hewn.Marrow/</a>.\n\nSecondarily, the audio samples may not be used in stock material. But please feel free to use it in your own creations. And if you do, please feel free to drop a line and share what you've made. I love hearing what people do with sounds in general.\n\nThank you.",

        "description": "I've been obsessed with iteration. More than that, I've been fixated on taking a single idea, and then applying as many permutations as I can to it. It is interesting to see how much variety can originate from a single source. This sample, as well as this pack in general is a testament to that. You have a simple drum beat, and then, I apply various effects then I iterate and continue ad nauseam.\n\nFor those who may care about the naming convention: each type of effect is labelled as FX###, and then each variation of parameters within that same effect is labelled by a following v###. Furthermore, if I decide to get ambitious I may iterated the same exact effect with the same parameters again (and again...), I indicate the number of iterations in the name of the track as well. And when I get super ambitious I may chain together effects, and then I indicate the \"infra-effect\" with an additional v### to indicate that I'm applying different effects to a single instance of a particular effect.\n\nAnyway, enough of the monotonous stuff.\n\nI hope you enjoy this stuff, I hope you can use it in your own work and that perhaps it sparks something in your mind about the power of iteration, change, and the unity that lies under the diverse manifestation of sound.\n\nAll I ask is that if you do use any of this in your work at all, to cite me as the origin of the samples, you can cite me, Hewn.Marrow by linking <a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/Hewn.Marrow/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://freesound.org/people/Hewn.Marrow/</a>.\n\nSecondarily, the audio samples may not be used in stock material. But please feel free to use it in your own creations. And if you do, please feel free to drop a line and share what you've made. I love hearing what people do with sounds in general.\n\nThank you.",

Furthermore, if I decide to get ambitious I may iterated the same exact effect with the same parameters again (and again...), I indicate the number of iterations in the name of the track as well.

It is interesting to see how much variety can originate from a single source. This sample, as well as this pack in general is a testament to that. You have a simple drum beat, and then, I apply various effects then I iterate and continue ad nauseam.\n\nFor those who may care about the naming convention: each type of effect is labelled as FX###, and then each variation of parameters within that same effect is labelled by a following v###. Furthermore, if I decide to get ambitious I may iterated the same exact effect with the same parameters again (and again...), I indicate the number of iterations in the name of the track as well. And when I get super ambitious I may chain together effects, and then I indicate the \"infra-effect\" with an additional v### to indicate that I'm applying different effects to a single instance of a particular effect.\n\nAnyway, enough of the monotonous stuff.\n\nI hope you enjoy this stuff, I hope you can use it in your own work and that perhaps it sparks something in your mind about the power of iteration, change, and the unity that lies under the diverse manifestation of sound.\n\nAll I ask is that if you do use any of this in your work at all, to cite me as the origin of the samples, you can cite me, Hewn.Marrow by linking <a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/Hewn.Marrow/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://freesound.org/people/Hewn.Marrow/</a>.\n\nSecondarily, the audio samples may not be used in stock material. But please feel free to use it in your own creations. And if you do, please feel free to drop a line and share what you've made. I love hearing what people do with sounds in general.\n\nThank you.",

        "description": "I've been obsessed with iteration. More than that, I've been fixated on taking a single idea, and then applying as many permutations as I can to it. It is interesting to see how much variety can originate from a single source. This sample, as well as this pack in general is a testament to that. You have a simple drum beat, and then, I apply various effects then I iterate and continue ad nauseam.\n\nFor those who may care about the naming convention: each type of effect is labelled as FX###, and then each variation of parameters within that same effect is labelled by a following v###. Furthermore, if I decide to get ambitious I may iterated the same exact effect with the same parameters again (and again...), I indicate the number of iterations in the name of the track as well. And when I get super ambitious I may chain together effects, and then I indicate the \"infra-effect\" with an additional v### to indicate that I'm applying different effects to a single instance of a particular effect.\n\nAnyway, enough of the monotonous stuff.\n\nI hope you enjoy this stuff, I hope you can use it in your own work and that perhaps it sparks something in your mind about the power of iteration, change, and the unity that lies under the diverse manifestation of sound.\n\nAll I ask is that if you do use any of this in your work at all, to cite me as the origin of the samples, you can cite me, Hewn.Marrow by linking <a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/Hewn.Marrow/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://freesound.org/people/Hewn.Marrow/</a>.\n\nSecondarily, the audio samples may not be used in stock material. But please feel free to use it in your own creations. And if you do, please feel free to drop a line and share what you've made. I love hearing what people do with sounds in general.\n\nThank you.",

        "description": "I've been obsessed with iteration. More than that, I've been fixated on taking a single idea, and then applying as many permutations as I can to it. It is interesting to see how much variety can originate from a single source. This sample, as well as this pack in general is a testament to that. You have a simple drum beat, and then, I apply various effects then I iterate and continue ad nauseam.\n\nFor those who may care about the naming convention: each type of effect is labelled as FX###, and then each variation of parameters within that same effect is labelled by a following v###. Furthermore, if I decide to get ambitious I may iterated the same exact effect with the same parameters again (and again...), I indicate the number of iterations in the name of the track as well. And when I get super ambitious I may chain together effects, and then I indicate the \"infra-effect\" with an additional v### to indicate that I'm applying different effects to a single instance of a particular effect.\n\nAnyway, enough of the monotonous stuff.\n\nI hope you enjoy this stuff, I hope you can use it in your own work and that perhaps it sparks something in your mind about the power of iteration, change, and the unity that lies under the diverse manifestation of sound.\n\nAll I ask is that if you do use any of this in your work at all, to cite me as the origin of the samples, you can cite me, Hewn.Marrow by linking <a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/Hewn.Marrow/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://freesound.org/people/Hewn.Marrow/</a>.\n\nSecondarily, the audio samples may not be used in stock material. But please feel free to use it in your own creations. And if you do, please feel free to drop a line and share what you've made. I love hearing what people do with sounds in general.\n\nThank you.",

Other parameters were mashed, some may have distortions some may not.\n\nAll the sounds you hear are synthesized.\n\nGenerally these sounds are for dance music, some of them are well suited for more experimental music as well. But it should not be limited to just techno or trance....",
