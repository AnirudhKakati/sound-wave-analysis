        "description": "Recorded in Poland, somewhere in the mid-autumn. Cloudy weather, small pond nearby a village and some local road. Pond hidden and surrounded by a heavy wicker. When you cross the wall of tangled plants - hundersts if not thousands of birds (probably the youth before migration to warmer regions before winter) yelling in a beautiful cacophony. From time to time a duck is screaming or just laughing. In the background - distant sounds may occur (like dogs). Recording taken with zoom H2 (internal mics), and a little bit remastered (highpass filter on 100Hz). Easy to remove artifacts came from holding the device in hands (difficult access). I think the distance was between 50 to 100 meters. Part 3 (access point/angle 3). There is a point, when a predatory bird appeared, and suddenly everything became silent. Then - thousands of wings, and a little bit after - birds relocated and began to yell even louder and more intense.",

The occasional murder of crows, maybe a seagull or two and some other birds I can't identify. \n\nRecorder (tascam dr-05x) set on windowsill, windows wide open. I had to cut quite a lot away as the mics would cut out causing dropouts throughout all frequencies. The mics on this recorder don't behave well under certain conditions, especially within high rise buildings when the windows are open. I've noticed it happens under bridges sometimes when air is moving in different directions, tried all sorts of different wind shields, but the problem persists.",

        "description": "Recorded in Poland, somewhere in the mid-autumn. Cloudy weather, small pond nearby a village and some local road. Pond hidden and surrounded by a heavy wicker. When you cross the wall of tangled plants - hundreds if not thousands of birds (probably the youth before migration to warmer regions before winter) yelling in a beautiful cacophony. From time to time a duck is screaming or just laughing. In the background - distant sounds may occur (like dogs). Recording taken with zoom H2 (internal mics), and a little bit remastered (highpass filter on 100Hz). Easy to remove artifacts came from holding the device in hands (difficult access). I think the distance was between 50 to 100 meters. Part 1 (access point/angle 1).",

        "description": "<p>This recording is backed and surrounded by a whole mass of related and often inspirational story. To put myself back there on that night for writing these notes, I'm in touch again with the power and 'electricity' of that night's experience, with shivers up the spine and near-tearfulness that this was all really happening, and not just a dream sent to torment me with the waking-up. &#8212; But this is the spot for the basic info, and a fuller, more contextual, account (connecting with a big and convoluted personal story), is to be found at my page <i><b><a href=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/all-night-recording-sessions.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">The inspiring frisson of an all-night recording session out in the wilds</a></b></i>.</p>\n<p>I made this recording as part of an all-night recording session on 18-19 June 2014. The exact location was at a carefully chosen spot on the top of the precipitous crag known as Sharp Tor, beside the Hunter's Path, Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK, quite near the well-known Castle Drogo.</p>That is nearly a kilometre to west of Hunting Gate, where I made <a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/Philip_Goddard/sounds/656898/\" rel=\"nofollow\">my other, concurrent dawn chorus recording</a>.<br>\n<p>This is a somewhat less quiet panorama than that one, because we're lower down, less distant from the River Teign and the birds in the lower part of the valley. The river is louder here too because of some rapids below, and also some sound is presumably being picked up from Drogo Weir, a little further upstream.</p>\n<p>Another difference is how the two choruses start. Here, prior to the main chorus, we hear a gentle (i.e., fairly distant) ensemble of nightjars. These are persistent, and form a foundation for the build-up of the main chorus, gradually getting buried in it and quietly bowing out, leaving it to the others to continue building this uplifting symphony. The kick-off of the start of the main chorus comes from robins, not song-thrush as in the Hunting Gate recording.</p><img alt=\"The Sharp Tor crag, looking west from Hunter's path\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/140619_sharp_tor_from_hunters_path,_v-early_morning.jpg\"><br><em>The Sharp Tor crag, from the Hunter's path just to the east of it. The arrow points to the recorder on its tripod, which is clearly visible in the full-resolution version of this image, while the little patch of valley fog is in the Chagford area, and high Dartmoor forms the distant skyline.</em><br>\n<p><b>Because of this being a primarily distant and thus quiet panorama, it's <em>NOT</em> a good idea to turn the volume up beyond a sensible <em>normal</em> setting. If you do so, you would certainly hear still more detail, but that would not be as I was hearing it, and also you'd find the occasional really close bird song very uncomfortably loud.</b></p>\n<p><b>The techie stuff:</b><br>I took with me two Sony PCM-M10 recorders, so I could record two concurrent dawn choruses, some distance apart (in the event, nearly a kilometre apart). Actually I started this recording about 1.30 a.m. BST, but this edited version starts probably about 3.45. The recorders were each fitted with a R&#248;de DeadKitten furry windshield (the original, more effective, light grey version).</p>\n<p>I placed the one for this recording perched on top of the Sharp Tor crag just by the seat, so it was just as well it was night and nobody was going to come here to sit and admire the non-view! The recorder was on a diminutive Hama Mini Tripod (something I'd not use nowadays, especially as the PCM-D100 recorder is really to heavy for it). It took me quite some time to find the likely best spot among the irregularities on the crag-top.</p>\n<p>The point was that I realized that much of the birdsong would be more or less distant, and that the sound of the River Teign here, as one would normally hear it, would mask quite a bit of that birdsong. So, the name of the game was to get an optimal balance between minimizing the river sound by bringing the recorder back from the absolute top prominences, and maximizing exposure to the distant birdsong by bringing it forward, to overlook the bottom of the valley.</p>\n<p>This involved my having to keep getting down into funny positions to try to assess the river sound as heard at the level of the recorder on that tiny tripod. As there was virtually no birdsong then, I could work only on the basis of the river sound &#8212; which meant in practice having to imagine the distant birdsong while I listened to the river sound at recorder level, and choose the minimum distance back from the edge that reduced the river sound just enough, set against my imaginary distant dawn chorus. Surely at least somebody out there will agree with me that I did a bloody good job in taking that little bit of trouble! <img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\"></p><img alt=\"The recorder just waiting for me to take it down\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/140619_recording_dawn_chorus_sharptor_teigng.jpg\"><br><i>The recorder just waiting for me to take it down, having done a brilliant job!</i><br>\n<p>Initial post-recording processing was to apply an EQ curve to compensate for muffling from the furry windshield, but much more recently I used the <i><b>A1 Stereo Control</b></i> VST plugin to widen and dramatically sharpen-up the appalling stereo imaging of the PCM-M10. That distinctly over-brightened each recording it was let loose on, and I rectified that by applying <strong>an EQ tilt as follows: a straight line from 100Hz (no change) to 8K (-7dB)</strong><strong></strong>. That then required a little compensatory level amplification (usually +3dB, but varied according to each recording).</p>\n<p>But then I realized I couldn't use this recording with that processing, because the river sound heard through speakers had nasty phasey effects and phase cancellation areas in the soundstage &#8212; an effect you don't get when listening with headphones. About to wail and gnash, I tried processing another copy of the recording with half the amount of the widening. Although I could still just hear that phasiness effect, it was much less prominent and I reckoned not enough to spoil one's listening. That required about half the amount of EQ tilt (to -3dB) and the compensatory level lift (typically 1.5dB), and got me altogether more natural and better-balanced sound. </p>\n<p>&#8230; And a reminder, that there's a fuller, more contextual account of that recording session at <i><b><a href=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/all-night-recording-sessions.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">The inspiring frisson of an all-night recording session out in the wilds</a></b></i>!</p>\n<p><b>Please remember to give this recording a rating! <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\"></b>\n</p>",

Inside this nature sanctuary, the birds feel safe.  The urban atmosphere is not far off. Yet it is just removed enough to share some solace with the birds. As a cadence, an airplane flies overhead.\n\nThis was recorded with 2 AKG Perception 420s, both set to figure-8 pattern, set up in a blumlein pattern, recorded to a Marantz PMD670. It was not a portable setup at all, but with a battery pack and inverter, I was able to get this setup out in the meadow, with permission from the park ranger.  We actually had a lovely conversation.  Treat your park rangers with respect.  Cheers.",

The most prominent bird overall sounds a bit like a blackbird to the 'newbie' (that was me, at that time!), but is really a mistle thrush.</b>\n\nI made this recording on 26 May 2013, concurrently with another at roughly the same height but a very few minutes' walk in the downstream direction (approx. north). You can hear that one at <a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/Philip_Goddard/sounds/699679/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://freesound.org/people/Philip_Goddard/sounds/699679/</a> .\n\nThis one has an interesting difference of situation. Whereas that one is on a very open and relatively uniform slope, this one is among larger boulders at the foot of a patch of very bouldery steeper slope, which is behind the recorder. In acoustic terms that's quite a big deal, because here the distant sounds all seem closer and more 'present', so this soundscape gains in 'presence' and clarity of everything, but loses a little of the almost other-worldly spaciousness and vastness of the other recording.\n\n<b>Advisory</b>\n\nHigh-grade headphones are recommended in order to hear all the detail. \n\n<img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/130526_recording_birds_etc._in_taw_valley,_from_slope_of_belstone_tors_ridge_02.jpg\" alt=\"This recording taking place\">\n<i>This recording taking place.</i>\n\n<b>Techie stuff:</b>\nThe recorder was a Sony PCM-M10, with one furry windshield &#8212; a R&#248;de DeadKitten (original, more effective, version) &#8212;, and placed on a Hama Mini tripod, which I regard as tiny rather than just mini!\n\nPost-recording processing was to apply EQ in Audacity to correct for the muffling effect of the windshield, and more recent processing with the A1 Stereo Control VST plugin (160% widening).\n\n<b>Please remember to give this recording a rating &#8212; Thank you! <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\"></b>",

As the skylark chorus becomes more sporadic, so other landlubber birds make appearance too, such as meadow pipit and linnet.</b>\n\nThis actually all-night recording session had a rather involved little story behind it, and to save me repeating myself here, you can read about that in the notes for my full skylark dawn chorus recording, <b><a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/Philip_Goddard/sounds/667643/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://freesound.org/people/Philip_Goddard/sounds/667643/</a></b>.\n\nWhat's really odd about how this recording came out is that I had the recorder on top of the drystone wall, <i>squarely facing into the field</i>, to maximize the skylarks' sound and downplay the sea sound, and yet, weirdly, the resulting recording sounds for all the world as though the recorder had been facing <i>along</i> the wall, with field-related sounds generally on the right and sea-related sounds on the left. I still don't understand how it worked out like that.\n\nI deliberately chose a position where almost all the (gentle) sea action was out of sight, so that its sound would be subdued and reasonably balanced with the birdsong over the field. Hence nearly all of what we do hear of it is echo from the cliffs that we can see from there.\n\nThe main seabirds we hear at times are herring gull (of course!), and, less frequently, great black-backed gull (imagine a ponderous version of herring gull calls, with an excruciatingly laryngitic voice!), with occasional brief piping calls of the odd oystercatchers.\n\n<img alt=\"From near Pentire Point &#8212; the coast path and rugged cliffs towards The Rumps\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/090419_rumps_point_and_cliffs_from_near_pentire_point.jpg\">\n<i>Photo taken on 19 April 2009, from near Pentire Point &#8212; rugged coastline to The Rumps, the rugged rather pinnacled little peninsula ahead, centre. Note the drystone wall just visible top right, which continues just a little back from cliff edge towards The Rumps, being the boundary of pasture fields where skylarks deliver beautiful choruses.\nI made this recording further along, much nearer The Rumps.</i>\n\n<img alt=\"The rugged clifftop and drystone wall towards The Rumps\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/120923_rugged_clifftop_near_the_rumps_01.jpg\">\n<i>Note how the drystone wall winds its way next to the Coast Path (the latter on this side), bounding the 'skylark-rich' pasture fields. Further along, as path and wall near The Rumps, the wall bears right, still with the path beside it, but the official Coast Path turns off, bearing a little left, passing through a well-vegetated disused quarry area.\nIt was there that I placed my R4 recorder for this recording &#8212; actually on top of the wall, so it faced into the field, with its back to the sea. Crazily, I didn't take any photos there, which is why all I can do is describe the spot.\nPhoto taken on 23 September 2012.</i>\n \n<b>Techie stuff:</b>\nThe recorder was a Sony PCM-D100, with three furry windshields (Windcut, custom), and it was placed on a Zipshot Mini tripod.\n\nPost-recording processing was to apply an EQ curve to compensate for muffling from the furry windshields, and, much more recently, noise reduction in Audacity was used to reduce somewhat the microphone self-noise (full frequency, not just the hiss).\n\n<b>Please remember to give this recording a rating -- Thanks! <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\"></b>",

The occasional murder of crows, maybe a seagull or two and some other birds I can't identify. \n\nRecorder (tascam dr-05x) set on windowsill, windows wide open. I had to cut quite a lot away as the mics would cut out causing dropouts throughout all frequencies. The mics on this recorder don't behave well under certain conditions, especially within high rise buildings when the windows are open. I've noticed it happens under bridges sometimes when air is moving in different directions, tried all sorts of different wind shields, but the problem persists.",

Woods mainly front and left, house and hillside behind, town right (1-2km.),slightly down.\r\nVery demanding soundstage to reproduce with wide range of distances, directions, and frequency bands. Some sounds have very limited bandwidth (eg. HF air attenuation at 1Km.+ ) making localization more tricky. Good test for headphone imaging.\r\nBest on headphones, but works quite well on stereo speakers.\r\nRoland Quad Capture to PC.\r\nUnfortunately there is some audible hiss from new aux. mics, if played too loud.\r\n<img alt=\"Garden and woods\" src=\"http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2866/8842109910_1677e97f64_z.jpg\" /><br />",

        "description": "This recording is backed and surrounded by a whole mass of related and often inspirational story. To put myself back there on that night for writing these notes, I'm in touch again with the power and 'electricity' of that night's experience, with shivers up the spine and near-tearfulness that this was all really happening, and not just a dream sent to torment me with the waking-up. &#8212; But this is the spot for the basic info, and a fuller, more contextual, account (connecting with a big and convoluted personal story), is to be found at my page <i><b><a href=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/all-night-recording-sessions.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">The inspiring frisson of an all-night recording session out in the wilds</a></b></i>.\n\nI made this recording as part of an all-night recording session on 18-19 June 2014. The exact location was just slightly east of Hunting Gate, the highest point on the Hunter's Path, Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK.\n\nTo convey as much as possible of the full dawn chorus experience, I've included a quite long 'lead-in' period, where you hear just the distant rushing of the River Teign down below in the valley, now and again a very faint tweet or twitter from some little birdie just wondering whether it's time to get up yet. &#8212; And then, ever so quietly, a distant nightjar starts churring on and off, before finally a song thrush down in the valley puts its head above the parapets, so to speak, and gives the cue for the other songbirds (initially mostly song-thrush and some robins) to start phasing in with their serenades, then with the odd yellowhammers and of course blackbirds piling in.\n\nOccasionally a male pheasant fairly nearby makes a rather startling transient disturbance, particularly once things have got going properly, though it did that once or twice before I started this recording.\n\nBy some half-hour in, a mind-boggling number of blackbirds are singing &#8212; mostly distant &#8212; always punctuated by other species of course. How could any well-functioning human not absolutely love and exalt in such multitudinous, celebratory-sounding, blackbird choruses?!\n\nNote that this is basically a distant and thus nearly all quiet panorama, facing across the deep, steep-sided valley, in a heathland clearing between patches of valley-slope copse and woodland. The other side of the valley is more consistently wooded &#8212; in fact largely forestry plantation, containing mostly conifer but some patches of broadleaved trees.\n\n<b>Advisory</b>\nBecause of this being a primarily distant and thus quiet panorama, it's <em>NOT</em> a good idea to turn the volume up beyond a sensible <em>normal</em> setting. If you do so, you would certainly hear still more detail, but that would not be as I was hearing it, and also you'd find the occasional really close bird song very uncomfortably loud.\n\n<img alt=\"Part of the visual panorama of this recording\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/140619_teign_gorge_from_e_of_hunting_gate_v-early_morning.jpg\">\n<em>The more western (upstream) part of the recording's panorama. The little patch of valley fog is in the Chagford area, and high Dartmoor forms the distant skyline.</em>\n\n<b>The techie stuff:</b>\nI took with me two Sony PCM-M10 recorders, so I could record two concurrent dawn choruses, some distance apart (in the event, nearly a kilometre apart). Actually I started this recording about 2.30 a.m. BST, but what's on this final, edited version starts at about 3.50, with the distant 'kick-off' twitterings of a song thrush down in the bottom of the valley insinuating themselves into one's awareness from about 8 minutes in. The recorders were each fitted with a R&#248;de DeadKitten furry windshield (the original, more effective, light grey version).\n\nI placed the one for this recording perched rather precariously as you can see in the photo, by means of a GorillaPod, just east of a line of copse running down the valley slope from Hunting Gate. I'd been thinking of placing it within the copse, but realized that the foliage close around would blur fine / distant detail in the soundscape, so chose to put it in the clearing just to the east, but still near enough to to the copse to benefit from some foreground birds singing from the trees there. &#8212; The irony of course was that for some arcane reason, in the event hardly any birds sang from there, so the recorded soundscape was mostly a distant one.\n\n<img alt=\"The recorder just waiting for me to take it down\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/140619_recording_dawn_chorus_huntinggate_teigng.jpg\">\n<i>The recorder just waiting for me to take it down, having done a brilliant job!</i>\n\nInitial post-recording processing was to apply an EQ curve to compensate for muffling from the furry windshield, but much more recently I used the <i><b>A1 Stereo Control</b></i> VST plugin to widen and dramatically sharpen-up the appalling stereo imaging of the PCM-M10. That distinctly over-brightened each recording it was let loose on, and I rectified that by applying <strong>an EQ tilt as follows: a straight line from 100Hz (no change) to 8K (-7dB)</strong>. That then required a little compensatory level amplification (usually +3dB, but varied according to each recording).\n\n&#8230; And a reminder, that there's fuller, more contextual account of that recording session at <i><b><a href=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/all-night-recording-sessions.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">The inspiring frisson of an all-night recording session out in the wilds</a></b></i>!\n\n<b>Please remember to give this recording a rating! <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\"></b>",

        "description": "On 5th March 2013 I took out with me a load of wind chimes, to my regular field recording location for wind chimes - the Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK. This time, however, although a moderate to fresh south-east wind was expected, for the first hour I was greeted by virtually complete calm - and, well, birds singing!\n\nSo I didn't rush on to the sort of places where I might hang wind chimes (looking silly, trying to record them with no wind!), and, on the Hunter's Path just past my closest point to Fingle Bridge (and high up above it), I set up on the very steep slope there to take a recording of the birds, with the rushing sound of the River Teign tumbling over rocks far down below. This recording, then, is the outcome.\n\nThe birds were mostly not very close, and hence the recording being quiet. It is just peaceful and refreshing.\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/hunters-path-woods-above-fingle-bridge.jpg\">\n<i>The Hunter's Path, high up on the steep sided Teign 'Gorge'. Fingle Bridge is way down at the bottom, more or less straight ahead in this photo. The recorder was on the slope below the track, but just behind me in this view.</i><br>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/recording-by-hunters-path-woods-above-fingle-bridge.jpg\">\n<i>The recorder very small and inconspicuous in this grand setting, its Rode Dead Kitten windshield showing up as it is a very light grey.</i><br>\n\nRecording made with a Sony PCM-M10 on a Velbon Mini Tripod, using the built-in microphones covered with a Rode Dead Kitten windshield. I have used a graphic EQ profile in Audacity to compensate for the slight muffling of the sound caused by the windshield. <b>Please note that the volume level of this recording has been carefully adjusted for listening purposes, and ALL my recordings so far are meant to be listened to with a volume setting that would give a realistic level for playback of CLASSICAL music (a large but not exceptional symphony orchestra). If you have the right volume setting, you should not need to change that setting from one recording of mine to another.</b>\n<p><i>(Later note: This recording - with better sound than here - is one of my CD-quality downloads, and can be found in <a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">my e-Store</a>.)</i></p>\n<p><b>Please remember to give this recording a rating! <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\"></b></p>",

Sound has been pitch/tempo shifted by 1 octave down (1 octave = 2 times; by changing the sound 1 octave down, you get 2x slower tempo and 2x lower pitch) and a touched little bit by EQ to make the sound clearer and more natural. Can be used as a sonic texture or a special effect or for educational purposes - to uncover the unheard world, that emerges when you change your octave of hearing.",

        "description": "<b>Peaceful springtime on open Dartmoor (Devon, UK), on lower flank of the Belstone Tors ridge, overlooking a copse in bottom of Taw valley. Distant birds (including occasional cuckoo calls), occasional sheep bleating, the constant distant sound of the River Taw tumbling over boulders in the stream bed &#8212; its sound strangely dispersed over the hillside beyond, thanks to a constant echo off all the boulders on that slope. The overall most prominent bird sounds a bit like a blackbird to the 'newbie' (that was me, at that time!), but is really a mistle thrush.</b>\n\nI made this recording on 26 May 2013, concurrently with another at roughly the same height but a very few minutes' walk in the upstream direction (approx. south), with an interesting difference of situation. You can hear it at <a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/Philip_Goddard/sounds/699680/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://freesound.org/people/Philip_Goddard/sounds/699680/</a> .\n\n<b>Advisory</b>\n\nHigh-grade headphones are recommended in order to hear all the detail. \n\n<img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/130526-130518_dartmoor_-_recording_birds_in_taw_valley_from_open_moor_01.jpg\" alt=\"View of earlier recording from same position\">\n<i>Earlier photo (18 May 2013) of recorder in same position as this time, and facing the same direction, towards the valley-bottom copse. Recorder is perched on a small boulder in about the middle of the bottom-left quarter of the photo (its light-grey furry windshield identifies it).</i>\n\n<b>Techie stuff:</b>\nThe recorder was a Sony PCM-M10, with one furry windshield &#8212; a R&#248;de DeadKitten (original, more effective, version) &#8212;, and placed on a Hama Mini tripod, which I regard as tiny rather than just mini!\n\nPost-recording processing was to apply EQ in Audacity to correct for the muffling effect of the windshield, and more recent processing with the A1 Stereo Control VST plugin (160% widening).\n\n<b>Please remember to give this recording a rating &#8212; Thank you! <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\"></b>",

        "description": "<b>Gentle sea and birds from clifftop near Land's End, with the rather bizarre excruciatingly laryngitic-sounding calls of great black-backed gulls in a colony on Enys Dodnan, the island with the arch (louder and clearer than in the other concurrent recording), and aerobatics and zingy calls from a family group of choughs later on. Also the inevitable herring gulls at times, with rock pipits, occasional jackdaws. In contrast with the other concurrent recording, the sea here is heard directly, from the other side of Zawn Wells, with some nice minor impacts and splashdowns on the cliffs there, which lead to Pordenack Point. &#8212; A peaceful but also exhilarating sea panorama with 'different' and distinguished atmosphere!</b>\n\nI recorded this \u2014 the more southerly of two concurrent recordings \u2014 on 26 June 2013, just back from the clifftop overlooking the minor narrow inlet called Zawn Wells, near Land's End, Penwith, Cornwall, UK, on a hike from Cape Cornwall, on the rocky and rugged coast path to Gwennap Head, near Porthgwarra. To quote from my journal:\n\n--------------------------\nAgain the swell was small and not going to make exciting recordings. The choughs were more vocal at various points from Cot Valley towards Gwynver, but I didn't see obvious places to stop for a recording for those, and was aiming for a lunch-stop recording where I'd made the spectacular clifftop recordings 3 weeks ago overlooking Enys Dodnan etc.\n\nIn the event I had a surprise, because as I was coming towards passing by Enys Dodnan I heard extremely rapidly repeated chough calls just ahead, and found that it was 3 young choughs together among the grass &amp; heather. I then backed off a bit and got out a recorder and used it hand-held using a Hama mini-tripod as a grip. After a very few minutes the three joined the parents, which were flying just below the clifftop, and they all went off in the Land's End direction.\n\nI then placed that recorder on a prominent rock and set up the other recorder a bit further along, facing more towards the higher line of cliff leading to Pordenack Point, and then had my lunch stop. The choughs stayed away then, but it was clearly a great soundscape, with a lot of interest from great black-backed gulls on Enys Dodnan, and periodic jackdaws and quite a lot of rock pipit sound. And then, just as I was about to stop the first recording, I heard a distant chough in the Land's End direction, so held off &#8212; and, sure enough, the five of them came back and were flying around. So I extended the session for probably some 15 min before reluctantly packing up and moving on, with the choughs still having a whale of a time there.\n--------------------------\n\n<b>Advisory</b>\n\nBecause of the processing to widen and sharpen the originally atrocious stereo imaging, the sea may sound rather phasey when listened to from certain speaker systems. Therefore high-grade headphones are by far the best solution.\n\n<img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/130626-130605_recording_on_pordenack_point_cliffs,_looking_over_zawn_wells_to_land%27s_end_02.jpg\" alt=\"Locations of this session's two recordings\">\n<i>Slightly earlier photo (6 June 2013) with much more boisterous sea, showing location of this session's two recordings here. The arrow points are almost on the recording spots. This recording was from the right-hand position, facing this way. Land's End is just beyond, off the photo.</i>\n\n<b>Techie stuff</b>\n\nThe recorder was Sony PCM-M10, with R&#248;de DeadKitten furry windshield (original, more effective, version). It was set up on a Zipshot Mini tripod, which is what I'd regard as 'midi', standing on a little rock surface among the stunted heather growth.\n\nPost-recording processing was to apply EQ in Audacity to correct for the muffling effect of the windshield &#8212; and then more recently stereo widening / sharpening-up using the VST plugin A1 Stereo Control (160% widening).\n\n<b>Please remember to give this recording a rating &#8212; Thank you!</b>&#160; <img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\">",

        "description": "Recorded in Poland, somewhere in the mid-autumn. Cloudy weather, small pond nearby a village and some local road. Pond hidden and surrounded by a heavy wicker. When you cross the wall of tangled plants - hundreds if not thousands of birds (probably the youth before migration to warmer regions before winter) yelling in a beautiful cacophony. From time to time a duck is screaming or just laughing. In the background - distant sounds may occur (like dogs). Recording taken with zoom H2 (internal mics), and a little bit remastered (highpass filter on 100Hz). Easy to remove artifacts came from holding the device in hands (difficult access). I think the distance was between 50 to 100 meters. Part 2 (access point/angle 2).",

The occasional murder of crows, maybe a seagull or two and some other birds I can't identify. \n\nRecorder (tascam dr-05x) set on windowsill, windows wide open. I had to cut quite a lot away as the mics would cut out causing dropouts throughout all frequencies. The mics on this recorder don't behave well under certain conditions, especially within high rise buildings when the windows are open. I've noticed it happens under bridges sometimes when air is moving in different directions, tried all sorts of different wind shields, but the problem persists.",

        "description": "<b>Full dawn chorus (pre-dawn to early morning) in edge of regrowing forestry in clear-felled area, among scattered Sitka spruce trees (Bellever Forest). Cuckoos periodically echoing / reverberating in the dense stands of the spruces not far off, and we're treated to a half-hour quiet nightjar chorus plus a lone melancholy-sounding distant cuckoo leading us in ever so gradually&#8230;</b>\n\n<b>Caution! The opening is very quiet. If you turn up the volume to anything more than a level that would give a good rendition of normal symphonic orchestral music, some of the later birdsong will be uncomfortably loud.</b>\n\nThis is one of four widely separated concurrent recordings that I made during the pre-dawn to early morning period on 1 June 2019, sheltered from an initially moderate but decreasing south-westerly breeze by self-seeded Sitka spruce trees outside the forestry perimeter on the north-west flank of Bellever Tor, near Postbridge, on Dartmoor, Devon, UK. \n\nAs I explain in detail on my page <b><i><a href=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/all-night-recording-sessions.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">The inspiring frisson of an all-night recording session alone in the wilds</a></i></b>, this session was the all-night 'final performance' &#8212; the culmination of my series of test and then 'rehearsal' recordings, which was underscored by detailed prospecting for optimal recorder placements, which were aimed towards my doing a greatly improved version of the previous year's somewhat blighted all-night session here, again for birds' full evening and dawn choruses, including nightjar choruses and plenty of cuckoo sound.\n\nWhereas in the 'dress rehearsal' for this session (evening / dusk, 14 May) all four recorders had been placed around the west / north-west flank of Bellever Tor, this time I wanted to increase their scope, so only two recorders were placed there, the other two being placed further north, more away from the tor, both just inside the edge of regrowing forestry.\n\nIdeally they'd have been just outside, in the clearing that runs very roughly northwards from Bellever Tor (particularly to capture nightjars, and, hopefully, skylarks), but there were no self-seeded Sitka spruce trees there to shelter the recorders, so I placed them as close to the main clearing as possible while keeping them sufficiently sheltered.\n\nThis recording is from my recorder labelled R4, at the most northerly position, just a little north of where the drystone wall that crosses the main clearing crosses the forestry perimeter, and, as I say, it was sheltered just within the regrowing forestry. I left it and the others running all night, to ensure that nothing important would be missed. Nightjars and cuckoos don't have much of an 'off' period in the short nights of this time of year, and there might always be something unexpected of interest in the middle of the night.\n\nIn the event, although the nightjars gave only a late and sparse performance for the recorders in the evening part of the session, they did much better for the pre-dawn into dawn period. This recording gets a pretty good showing of that, especially considering the constraints imposed by having to have the recorder sheltered from the breeze. This is a beautifully atmospheric effect, especially with the punctuations from occasional cuckoo episodes.\n\nThose cuckoos echo / reverberate really nicely, but that effect is not from the dense stand of spruces west of Bellever Tor, but from the same on and in vicinity of Lakehead Hill, a little NNW of this spot.\n\n<img alt=\"Telephoto view of partly felled forestry on Lakehead Hill\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/190531_partially_clear-felled_part_of_bellever_forest_near_sunset.jpg\">\n<i>Telephoto view from other side of main clearing, of partially felled forestry on Lakehead Hill, NNW from Bellever Tor, taken during the evening part of the session.

R4 (for this recording) is the furthest, with R5 and R6 off to left.</i>\n\nA fuller, more contextual, description of this session (as the culmination of a sequence of prospecting and rehearsal sessions, to greatly improve on the previous year's blighted all-night session here), is to be found at my page <i><b><a href=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/all-night-recording-sessions.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">The inspiring frisson of an all-night recording session out in the wilds</a></b></i>.\n\n<b>Techie stuff:</b>\nThe recorder was a Sony PCM-D100, unusually with just one furry windshield (Windcut, custom), and it was placed on a Hama normal-size lightweight tripod.\n\nInitial post-recording processing was to apply an EQ curve to compensate for muffling from the furry windshield, and applying dynamic EQ using the VST plugin TDR Nova GE with a custom preset to greatly minimize the odd bits of wind disturbance that did occur. \n\n<b>Please remember to give this recording a rating! <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\"></b>",

        "description": "<b>Full dawn chorus (pre-dawn to early morning) in position sheltered by self-seeded Sitka spruce trees a little outside forestry periphery, west of the tor, facing NNE. Cuckoos periodically echoing / reverberating in the dense stands of the spruces not far off, and we're treated to a half-hour quiet nightjar chorus plus a lone melancholy-sounding distant cuckoo leading us in ever so gradually&#8230;</b>\n\n<b>Caution! The opening is very quiet. If you turn up the volume to anything more than a level that would give a good rendition of normal symphonic orchestral music, some of the later birdsong will be uncomfortably loud. Also, please note that, like any <em>full</em> dawn chorus, it's very much for those people with long attention span \u2014 especially during the first half-hour, by which time the unfolding of the chorus is noticeably accelerating.</b>\n\nThis is one of four widely separated concurrent recordings that I made during the pre-dawn to early morning period on 1 June 2019, sheltered from an initially moderate but decreasing south-westerly breeze by self-seeded Sitka spruce trees outside the forestry perimeter on the west flank of Bellever Tor, near Postbridge, on Dartmoor, Devon, UK. \n\nAs I explain in detail on my page <i><b><a href=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/all-night-recording-sessions.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">The inspiring frisson of an all-night recording session alone in the wilds</a></b></i>, this session was the all-night 'final performance' &#8212; the culmination of my series of test and then 'rehearsal' recordings, which was underscored by detailed prospecting for optimal recorder placements, which were aimed towards my doing a greatly improved version of the previous year's somewhat blighted all-night session here, again for birds' full evening and dawn choruses, including nightjar choruses and plenty of cuckoo sound.\n\nWhereas in the 'dress rehearsal' for this session (evening / dusk, 14 May) all four recorders had been placed around the west / north-west flank of Bellever Tor, this time I wanted to increase their scope, so only two recorders were placed there, the other two being placed further north, more away from the tor, both just inside the edge of regrowing forestry. Ideally they'd have been just outside, in the clearing that runs very roughly northwards from Bellever Tor (particularly to capture nightjars, and, hopefully, skylarks), but there were no self-seeded Sitka spruce trees there to shelter the recorders, so I placed them as close to the main clearing as possible.\n\nThis recording is from my recorder labelled R6, at the most southerly position used in this session. I left it and the others running all night, to ensure that nothing important would be missed. Nightjars and cuckoos don't have much of an 'off' period in the short nights of this time of year, and there might always be something unexpected of interest in the middle of the night.\n\nIn the event, although the nightjars gave only a late and sparse performance for the recorders in the evening part of the session, they did much better for the pre-dawn into dawn period. This recording gets a pretty good showing of that, especially considering the constraints imposed by having to have the recorder sheltered from the breeze. This is a beautifully atmospheric effect, especially with the punctuations from occasional cuckoo episodes. Those cuckoos echo / reverberate really nicely in the dense stand of forestry to west (on the left round to rather behind).\n\nHowever, there is a disappointment, in that the nightjars, apart from a single one that gave a performance near the recorder, are all sufficiently distant that they're difficult to hear from really good speakers, even though I can hear them quite distinctly (albeit mostly very quiet) on my Audio-Technica ATH-M50x headphones. If you want to hear a more distinct nightjar chorus, the best place I can offer currently is <a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/Philip_Goddard/sounds/662282/\" rel=\"nofollow\">the concurrent recording by R4</a> in that session.\n\nAlso, later in the recording certain birds, especially willow warbler, sang a bit too close, and that forced me to reduce their level somewhat for tolerably comfortable listening. That processing in turn causes a slight dip in the background sound during those brief reduced peaks.\n\n<img alt=\"The recorder set up for this recording, while recording the previous evening's bird chorus \" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/190531_sound_recording_in_edge_of_forestry,_bellever_tor,_dartmoor.jpg\">\n<i>The recorder for this recording, already set up and recording during the previous evening, to run continuously till early morning packing-up time. The black furry windshield can just be made out, and below it the light speck is the high-vis / reflective strip around the top of the tripod.\nThere are more gaps between the trees than is evident in this view. The recorder is facing the quite wide gap between the trees on left and the left-most of the trees behind, and it has an open wide panorama to west &#8212; i.e., in this direction, towards the stand of forestry that gives us the echoes / reverbs from the cuckoos and indeed occasionally cattle. Those effects would thus all be heard on the left side of the recording.</i>\n\n<img alt=\"View NNW from Bellever Tor, showing recorder locations\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/190601_nnw_from_bellever_tor,_post-sunrise_-_bellever_forest_and_high_moor_02.jpg\">\n<i>Looking roughly NNW from Bellever Tor, pointing out recorder placements for this all-night session, towards the end of the session early the morning. R4 is the furthest, with R5 and R6 off to left &#8212; the latter being the furthest south.</i>\n\nA fuller, more contextual, description of this session (as the culmination of a sequence of prospecting and rehearsal sessions, to greatly improve on the previous year's blighted all-night session here), is to be found at my page <i><b><a href=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/all-night-recording-sessions.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">The inspiring frisson of an all-night recording session out in the wilds</a></b></i>.\n\n<b>Techie stuff:</b>\nThe recorder was a Sony PCM-D100, unusually with just one furry windshield (Windcut, custom), and it was placed on a Hama normal-size lightweight tripod.\n\nInitial post-recording processing was to apply an EQ curve to compensate for muffling from the furry windshield, and the dynamic compressor VST plugin <i><b>TDR Kotelnikov</b></i> to reduce the level of some over-obliging birds that came to sing too close to the recorder &#8212; always a hazard when one relies on trees to give shelter to the recorder!\n\nAlthough I consistently failed get acceptable results with Kotelnikov or indeed other compressors for dealing with lightning strikes or firework displays (transient weird balance where a sudden loud sound is tamed), I find the results with over-loud birds relatively effective and transparent, though where there is noticeable continuous background sound I do notice a gentle dip in that sound coinciding with the reduced peaks, which isn't at all ideal but at least is better than having those birds so disproportionately and uncomfortably loud.\n\n<b>Please remember to give this recording a rating! <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\"></b>",

        "description": "Spring evening birdsong low down on flank of Bellever Tor, among scattered Sitka spruce trees, with forestry plantation nearby (Bellever Forest).\n\nThis is one of four widely separated concurrent recordings that I made on the evening of 14 May 2019, sheltered from a stiff easterly breeze by self-seeded Sitka spruce trees outside the forestry perimeter on the north-west flank of Bellever Tor, near Postbridge, on Dartmoor, Devon, UK. The breeze eased off a fair bit gradually during the evening.\n\nAs I explain in detail on my page <b><a href=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/all-night-recording-sessions.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">The inspiring frisson of an all-night recording session alone in the wilds</a></b>, this session was a step in my series of 'rehearsal' test recordings, underscored by detailed prospecting for optimal recorder placements, which were aimed towards my doing a greatly improved version of the previous year's somewhat blighted all-night session here, again for birds' full evening and dawn choruses, including nightjar choruses and plenty of cuckoo sound.\n\nSeeing this session in retrospective context, it's conveniently regarded as the 'dress rehearsal' for the 'final performance' that came on the night of 31 May to 1 June. However, cold conditions forced me to abandon this session as it was getting dark, so I was unable to stay for the dawn chorus.\n\nAll four recordings were made in the shelter of self-seeded Sitka spruce trees close to the forestry perimeter, on the Bellever Tor side. This recording is from the most northerly position, close to where a minor unofficial track branches off from the rough forestry perimeter track, leading SSE up to Bellever Tor summit.\n\nAs I noted in my journal, \"Some cuckoos did sound during the recordings, mostly early on &#8212; but no real star performances.&#160; I heard no blackbirds, apart from the odd distant hint of one when I was on the tor, and briefly heard a song thrush and the odd willow warbler.&#160; No nightjars.&#160; There seemed to be altogether too little birdsong to make worthwhile recordings.\"\n\nIt was therefore a great pleasure when I came to audition and edit the recordings, to find that they had each captured quite a lot of bird activity. Indeed, surprisingly, this particular recording had <em>too much</em> blackbird, would you believe! In particular, there was an insufferable period of some 23 minutes with this particular blackbird very close and thus uncomfortably loud, and very persistent. I rebelled and cut out 20 minutes of that, because one couldn't listen to anything much else in that time. I haven't cut that out of the original, but I did it to the copy to post here, to spare you nice listeners such purgatory &#8212; and I say that as a great lover of blackbird song generally!\n\n<img alt=\"Looking up slope to Bellever Tor, with self-seeded Sitka spruce trees in foreground\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/190420_bellever_tor,_with_heather_moorland_with_scattered_self-seeded_sitka_spruce.jpg\"><br><i>Looking up the slope to Bellever Tor.

        "description": "<b>Spring evening birdsong in edge of regrowing forestry in clear-felled area, among scattered Sitka spruce trees (Bellever Forest). Cuckoos periodically echoing / reverberating in the dense stands of the spruces not far off, and eventual nightjars.</b>\n\nThis is one of four widely separated concurrent recordings that I made on the evening of 31 May 2019, sheltered from a moderate but gradually decreasing south-westerly breeze by self-seeded Sitka spruce trees outside the forestry perimeter on the north-west flank of Bellever Tor, near Postbridge, on Dartmoor, Devon, UK. The breeze gradually eased off a fair bit during the evening.\n\nAs I explain in detail on my page <b><i><a href=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/all-night-recording-sessions.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">The inspiring frisson of an all-night recording session alone in the wilds</a></i></b>, this session was the all-night 'final performance' in my series of test and then 'rehearsal' recordings, underscored by detailed prospecting for optimal recorder placements, which were aimed towards my doing a greatly improved version of the \nprevious year's somewhat blighted all-night session here, again for birds' full evening and dawn choruses, including nightjar choruses and plenty of cuckoo sound.\n\nWhereas in the 'dress rehearsal' for this session (evening / dusk, 14 May) all four recorders had been placed around the west / north-west flank of Bellever Tor, this time I wanted to increase their scope, so only two recorders were placed there, the other two being placed further north, more away from the tor, both just inside the edge of regrowing forestry. Ideally they'd have been just outside, in the clearing that runs very roughly northwards from Bellever Tor (particularly to capture nightjars, and, hopefully, skylarks), but there were no self-seeded Sitka spruce trees there to shelter the recorders from the breeze, so I placed them as close to the main clearing as possible while keeping them sufficiently sheltered.\n\nThis recording is from my recorder labelled R4, at the most northerly position, just a little north of where the drystone wall that crosses the main clearing enters the forestry, and, as I say, the recorder was sheltered just within the regrowing forestry. I left it and the others running all night, to ensure that nothing important would be missed. Nightjars and cuckoos don't have much of an 'off' period in the short nights of this time of year.\n\nIn the event, the nightjars gave only a late and sparse performance for the recorders this evening, but did much better for the pre-dawn into dawn period. This recording gets one particularly close nightjar late on, and then we hear only the odd fairly distant one. However, this is still a beautifully atmospheric effect, especially with the punctuations from occasional cuckoo episodes. Those cuckoos echo / reverberate really nicely, but that effect is no longer from the dense stand of spruces west of Bellever Tor, but from the same on and in the vicinity of Lakehead Hill, a little NNW of this spot.\n\n<img alt=\"Telephoto view of partly felled forestry on Lakehead Hill\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/190531_partially_clear-felled_part_of_bellever_forest_near_sunset.jpg\">\n<i>Telephoto view from other side of main clearing, of partially felled forestry on Lakehead Hill, NNW from Bellever Tor.

The past three mornings this easter, i've been chasing a couple of woodpeckers, but every time i started recording, they'd stop pecking for food. \r\n\r\nThis morning at around 8am i finally caught them, and not only for a few minutes. The wind was almost not present, and the sun was shining as if the summer had already come to the west coast of Denmark.\r\n\r\nI've set my Zoom H2 on the 90 degree angle, to get a more concentrated recording of the woodpecker. I didn't dare come closer than i was, so there's a lot of birds in the foreground, but even though, i think the woodpecker gets through just fine.  ",

        "description": "\u0160ikole - is a village in the Municipality of Kidri\u010devo in northeastern Slovenia. The area is part of the traditional region of Styria. \u0160ikole was first attested in written sources in 1374 as Sycolach (and as Sykhawlou in 1441 and Sycolach in 1493). The name is derived from *\u0160ikov\u013e(an)e, probably based on the root *\u0161ik- (cf. Slovene \u0161ikara 'thicket, bushes' and Kostel dialect \u0161ikara 'steep area difficult to access'), referring to a local geographical feature. According to the latest data from 2020, it has 310 inhabitants.\n\nYou hear the following birds:\n\nHouse Sparrow\nBarn Swallow\nEurasian Collared-Dove\nEuropean Starling\n\n<a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:%C5%A0ikole_-_zjutraj.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"\u0160ikole - zjutraj\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/%C5%A0ikole_-_zjutraj.jpg/512px-%C5%A0ikole_-_zjutraj.jpg\"></a>\n\nRecorder: HUAWEI BLA-L29\n\nIf any of these sounds have been of help, and you are feeling charitable, please do consider <a href=\"https://freesound.org/donations/donate/\" rel=\"nofollow\">donating to Freesound.org</a> to help keep the site running (a link is also on the home page).

Yet it is just removed enough to share some solace with the birds.\n\nThis was recorded with 2 AKG Perception 420s, both set to figure-8 pattern, set up in a blumlein pattern, recorded to a Marantz PMD670. It was not a portable setup at all, but with a battery pack and inverter, I was able to get this setup out in the meadow, with permission from the park ranger.  We actually had a lovely conversation.  Treat your park rangers with respect.  Cheers.",

I think its all the twists and turns in the tree limbs (and the fact that it is close to other berry and seed natives).  Here is a link to over 20 minutes of early morning Carolina Wren bird melodies I think you'll enjoy anytime during your day.  For such a small bird, this wren's calls are voluminous and majestic.  They are busy nest building and pairing up for spring.  Background noise is typical urban hum. F6 and Sennheiser MKH416 with tripod and Sennheiser dead cat.",

Only then it was summer and it was the spot to go fishing for trout in this waterreservoir in the Harzmountains. \n\nIt was a foggy afternoon at the end of November with still a number of people about and no noise apart from that. \n\nThe original recording with a Sony PCM D100 was okay, but I had to boost it up for what you can hear now: a mysterious bird.

        "description": "On 24 April 2016 I took out my recently purchased Sony PCM-D100 recorder to Branscombe Landslip, near Beer, Devon, UK, to record there, in the landslip's beautiful reverberant acoustic, for as much of the day as was practical (about 10.15 a.m. to 6.0 p.m.), making concurrent recordings with that recorder and a PCM-M10, to see how they compared.\n\nThe results can reasonably be described as astounding. Over these last few years I'd been under the impression, like many other people, that the PCM-M10's recordings were brilliant - spacious and full of detail, and generally greatly lifelike. But now, having heard the M10 recordings alongside similar albeit not completely identical recordings made with the D100 on this day, I've been feeling quite embarrassed that I'd been putting in public display recordings that I now recognise as actually having a seriously blurred stereo image and a sort of sonic fogginess that obscures a whole mass of detail.\n\nI came to the conclusion that I was very unlikely ever again to record with a PCM-M10. After toying with the idea of using external mics with the M10 in future, I came to the conclusion that I was very unlikely ever again to record with a PCM-M10 at all, as external mics are a lot of additional gear to squeezed into my already very full rucksack on my hiking outings. Instead, in order to have two recorders as I'm used to working with, I actually ordered a second D100.\n\nI should emphasize that I always use the D100 with the 120-degree wide stereo mic configuration. Its 90-degree XY setting produces a very narrow soundstage that has no relevance to recordings of natural soundscapes.\n\n(Later note, February 2021 - last year some experimentation showed that with the D100 I should be able to get excellent wide-soundstage **zoomed-in** recordings with the D100 set at 90-degrees XY, by the simple means of post-recording processing with the VST plugin A1StereoControl, in two passes, the first at 200% and the second at 110%. I can't wait to get out to some of my prime recording sites to get some zoomed-in recordings like that - no more so than the hilarious colony of guillemots in a large cave in the south-side cliffs of Pentargon Cove, near Boscastle, Cornwall.)\n\nAnyway, I decided I would delete the M10 recordings I made on this day, to save space on my computer, despite their being excellent recordings in terms of what the M10 can do. I thought, however, that some people would appreciate these recordings despite their shortcomings, and so I am sharing them all here before I delete them from my system.\n\nThis is the first of these M10 recordings, and was made from a tree branch part way up a steep and precarious narrow track leading towards a cave high up on the chalk cliff towering above. The recorder is facing roughly west, with the sea curiously sounding from the right whereas it was straight ahead, despite there being no channel imbalance! As usual the windshield was the Rode DeadKitten (old light-grey version, which performs better than the current black version). I used Audacity to apply a custom EQ profile to correct for the high frequency muffling caused by the windshield and also to correct for the audible broad 'hump' in the bass frequencies of ALL my PCM-M10 recordings prior to processing.\n\nWe are actually shielded by a lower small cliff from most of the direct sea sound, so the latter is rather muffled, and it is actually echoing beautifully on the cliff towering above, though that can't really be made out in this recording. Various birds are singing and often answering others of same species in different parts of the landslip and undercliff.\n\nPlease note that the volume level of this recording has been carefully adjusted for listening purposes, and, except where otherwise expressly indicated, ALL my recordings so far are meant to be listened to with a volume setting that would give a realistic level for playback of CLASSICAL music (a large but not exceptional symphony orchestra). If you have the right volume setting, you should not need to change that setting from one recording of mine to another.\n\nALL my recordings are COPYRIGHT, with all rights reserved apart from the 'attribution' non-commercial use provision of the licence given for this recording.

        "description": "Taken on 17th June 2012 on the clifftop from the coast path near Buckator, between Crackington Haven and Boscastle, Cornwall, UK. Several stonechats were flitting around in a patch of gorse and uttering their unmistakable little 'chat!' sounds like hitting two pebbles together.\n\nThe background sea noise is muted because this is rather back from the cliff edge. This recording was actually rather spoiled by the quite modest breeze, despite my use of a Rycote Mini Windjammer on my Sony PCM-M10 (using internal mics). I therefore took the liberty (which I want to avoid generally) of using some EQ in WavePad to tame the wind sound and bring the birds a bit more to the fore.\n\nPlease note that the volume level of this recording has been carefully adjusted for listening purposes, and ALL my recordings so far are meant to be listened to with a volume setting that would give a realistic level for playback of CLASSICAL music (a large but not exceptional symphony orchestra). If you have the right volume setting, you should not need to change that setting from one recording of mine to another.\n<p><b>Please remember to give this recording a rating! <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\"></b></p>",

        "description": "On 24 April 2016 I took out my recently purchased Sony PCM-D100 recorder to Branscombe Landslip, near Beer, Devon, UK, to record there, in the landslip's beautiful reverberant acoustic, for as much of the day as was practical (about 10.15 a.m. to 6.0 p.m.), making concurrent recordings with that recorder and a PCM-M10, to see how they compared. \n\nThe results can reasonably be described as astounding. Over these last few years I'd been under the impression, like many other people, that the PCM-M10's recordings were brilliant - spacious and full of detail, and generally greatly lifelike. But now, having heard the M10 recordings alongside similar albeit not completely identical recordings made with the D100 on this day, I've been feeling quite embarrassed that I'd been putting in public display recordings that I now recognise as actually having a seriously blurred stereo image and a sort of sonic fogginess that obscures a whole mass of detail.\n\nI came to the conclusion that I was very unlikely ever again to record with a PCM-M10. After toying with the idea of using external mics with the M10 in future, I came to the conclusion that I was very unlikely ever again to record with a PCM-M10 at all, as external mics are a lot of additional gear to squeezed into my already very full rucksack on my hiking outings. Instead, in order to have two recorders as I'm used to working with, I actually ordered a second D100.\n\nI should emphasize that I always use the D100 with the 120-degree wide stereo mic configuration. Its 90-degree XY setting produces a very narrow soundstage that has no relevance to recordings of natural soundscapes.\n\n(Later note, February 2021 - last year some experimentation showed that with the D100 I should be able to get excellent wide-soundstage **zoomed-in** recordings with the D100 set at 90\u00b0 XY, by the simple means of post-recording processing with the VST plugin A1 Stereo Control, in two passes, the first at 200% and the second at 110%. I can't wait to get out to some of my prime recording sites to get some zoomed-in recordings like that - no more so than the hilarious colony of guillemots in a large cave in the south-side cliffs of Pentargon Cove, near Boscastle, Cornwall.)\n\n[<i><b>2024 annotation</b>\n\u2014 I since found that I'd been considerably overdoing the widening for the M10 recordings. By careful experimentation I found that about 160\u00b0 widening gave the most faithful and coherent stereo image, and redid the widening for all my M10 recordings previously so over-widened.</i>]\n\nAnyway, I decided I would delete the M10 recordings I made on this day, to save space on my computer, despite their being excellent recordings in terms of what the M10 can do. I thought, however, that some people would appreciate these recordings despite their shortcomings, and so I am sharing them all here before I delete them from my system.\n\nThis is the final of the two parts of the third of these M10 recordings made on that day, and was made from a tripod right beside the coast path in an openly wooded part of the landslip, just round the corner from where a steep and precarious narrow track leading towards a cave high up on the chalk cliff towering above comes out on the main path. The recorder is facing approximately north, facing the chalk cliff towering above, in an attempt to maximally capture the echo of each wave as it spread along the cliff from left to right - but as usual it has made a complete hash of that.\n\nThe 'direct' (actually shielded) sea sound was actually hard left, not just left-of-centre, and the echo of each wave could be clearly heard moving from left to right on the cliff, instead of just the vague haze of sound from the cliff that the M10 'hears'.  By contrast, the D100 captured the echoes faithfully, to such an extent that I really felt I could hear the shape of the cliff face towering above!\n\nAs usual the windshield was the Rode DeadKitten (old light-grey version, which performs better than the current black version). I used Audacity to apply a custom EQ profile to correct for the high frequency muffling caused by the windshield and also to correct for the audible broad 'hump' in the bass frequencies of ALL my PCM-M10 recordings prior to processing.\n\nVarious birds are singing and often answering others of same species in different parts of the landslip and undercliff. The striking and perhaps rather scary-sounding repeated squealing wails are from a peregrine falcon, one or a pair of which periodically did little flyabouts, no doubt as a courtship thing at this time of year. Often such calls were preceded by the sound of an agitated and no doubt frightened raven being chased by the peregrine that was subsequently to utter its wailing calls.\n\nAnother distinctive sound from the peregrine(s) was a sort of chattering - a fast succession of 'clicks' with an intense rather squealed quality about them; this was actually a very loud sound compared with the various alarm calls made by the songbirds, for it was generally made from high cliff perch or nesting positions and yet still stood out from all the nearby songbirds' alarm calls.\n\nPlease note that the volume level of this recording has been carefully adjusted for listening purposes, and, except where otherwise expressly indicated, ALL my recordings so far are meant to be listened to with a volume setting that would give a realistic level for playback of CLASSICAL music (a large but not exceptional symphony orchestra). If you have the right volume setting, you should not need to change that setting from one recording of mine to another.\n\nALL my recordings are COPYRIGHT, with all rights reserved apart from the 'attribution' non-commercial use provision of the licence given for this recording.

HQ Pond is home to a variety of wildlife species, including alligators, turtles, wading birds, and ducks. The surrounding marshes and woodlands also provide habitat for numerous species of mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians which all frequent the pond.  This lively audio is of sunrise bird and cricket calls across the pond. Birds on the recording include grunting cormorants, coots and gallinules, yellowthroats, herons, egrets, red winged blackbirds, assorted wrens and others.  Mole crickets and field crickets provide the background chirping.  The audio is full of lively activity with multifaceted communications between the birds as they greet the sun and begin their day.  Great for daily background nature music or to bring the sounds of the wildlife refuge into your space.  Audio is just over an hour &amp; a portion of an overnight recording using Sony PCM recorders and Clippy microphones.",

Sad but true.\n\nRecorder: ZOOM H4n Pro\n\nIf any of these sounds have been of help, and you are feeling charitable, please do consider <a href=\"https://freesound.org/donations/donate/\" rel=\"nofollow\">donating to Freesound.org</a> to help keep the site running (a link is also on the home page).

This is heard in the forests as the new winged arrivals from central America, and the Caribbean islands have arrived here in our insect-laden woods to feast and raise a family.\nAmong the birds you hear in this recording, the Northern Parula, Gray Gnatcatcher and several alarmed Pileated Woodpeckers. Off and on you also hear the delicate tap-tap-tapping of some species of woodpecker pounding on a dead tree looking for food.\n\nAlso, a special treat, what would warm weather be without bees investigating my microphone!  Twice you will hear a very close bee-buzz.\nEnjoy.\nDate of Record:  Sunday April 14, 2024\nEquipment: Sony PMD 100 with built-in condenser microphones.",

        "description": "New location - Slovenja vas is a village in the Municipality of Hajdina, located on the terrace of the Drava River along the Maribor-Ptuj road, closer to the eastern border of the Drava Field. Fields spread around the village. The drainage channel of the Zlatoli\u010dje HPP is laid under the village. The population is mixed, workers and farmers.\nThe stream Hajdinska Studen\u010dnica once originated below the settlement, which dried up after the construction of the Drava canal for the hydroelectric plant. The village lies at an altitude of 235m and is quite spread out.\nSpecial features are the water tower next to the main road, the industrial zone on the outskirts of the village, adjacent to Zlatoli\u010dje, and the drainage canal of the hydroelectric plant. Kartodrom Slovenja vas, opened in 2018, is located near Ptuj. In the center stands the Church of the Assumption, built in 1992.\n\nBirds:\n\nEurasian Blackcap\nEurasian Tree Sparrow\nCommon Chiffchaff\nEurasian Blackbird\nBlack Woodpecker\nYellowhammer\nHawfinch\nEurasian Blue Tit\n\n\n<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/26/Slovenja_vas_-_preko_kanala.jpg\">\n\n\nRecorder: HONOR REA-NX9\n\nIf any of these sounds have been of help, and you are feeling charitable, please do consider <a href=\"https://freesound.org/donations/donate/\" rel=\"nofollow\">donating to Freesound.org</a> to help keep the site running (a link is also on the home page).
