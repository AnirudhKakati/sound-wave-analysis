Enjoy, more to come soon, please request a siren that you guys would like me to do, I'm more than willing to take requests. Please rate and comment, and of course, download and use. This sound was designed for small war type movies and other things warning related. The siren does a 30 second Alert tone so I don't know how you guys would use it. I'd do attack but its kind of hard to do. Anyways guys, thanks for listening and downloading all of my other sounds, it really helped me to become popular on Freesound :-)",

        "description": "Hi. This is a loop of Aurora Colorado's\r\nold Whelen WPS-3016 system test. The city had 3016's, and WPS-2810's. They did the WAIL tone for 3 minutes, and the WHOOP tone for 30 seconds. This is a one sycle loop of the WAIL tone. You can hear the other sirens in the system in the background, as well as some very excited dogs that where barking during the whole test. I don't know the exact location of this siren. Also, the system has been removed and replaced with new whelens a couple of years ago. They had a yellow WPS-3016 in the sistem Hope you like it. I'll get a loop of the WHOOP tone soon. If you download this, or any of my other sounds for that matter, and use it in your production or any other thing, then please give me good credit. Thanks, and good bye.",

On a flat hilltop with dry weeds.\n\nThis is the Recording of the Emergency Alert System Test (Warntag) in Germany on September 10, 2020 at 11:00 CET. \n\nTwo or three steps of mine are heard just when the sirens start, i apologise. The H1n did pretty well for this very large and distant ambience, also 3 minutes ago two adults with very loud children passed through and almost ruined the recording.\n\nNext time i'll be better prepared (in one year, that is), and hopefully the german emergency system will be, too (press is reporting of a failure).\n\nTo my surprise, there was no all-clear signal, which i waited for, for 20 minutes.",

The graphs are:\r\n1st note: power of 2 (ie Square)\r\n2nd note: cube root\r\n3rd note: geometric sequence with common ratio of 0.5\r\n4th note: square root\r\n\r\nThis sound is effectively mono, i.e. the left and right channels are identical.\r\n\r\nThis sound has been created using the Kangas Sound Editor, an open-source/freeware program available from multiple download sites on the Internet.",

        "description": "Tsunami in Japan was created with a mix of recorded songs and also the creation of several tracks. \r\n\r\nFirst I generated 3 differents noises (I changed the height of the first one by reducing 2 times 30 half tons, I increased the height at the end for the second one and reduced a little the height of the third noise). I finished by adding reverb (60%) used \"Wah Wah\" effect and fade out. By doing this, I got the saturation that I wanted, creating the impression of the sound of a real tsunami.\r\n\r\nAfter I used registered songs of seagulls, waves and sirens. I added reverb (39%) for all of my tracks and repeated the song of the siren 3 times. I also used the effect \"normalisation\" and used the effect \"noise decrease\" and fade in. I wanted that when the tsunami arrives, the sound looks like an explosion.\r\nDescription: Everything was perfect and quiet in this small island of Japan, the beach, the sound of the seagulls ... when suddenly we can hear the trembling sound of sirens. Yes, the tsunami is here, ready to destroy everything.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nDescriptif selon la typologie de Schaeffer :\r\nTypologie : continu complexe (X) \r\nMasse : Groupe nodal avec sons complexes)\r\nTimbre harmonique : acide, doux, puis granuleux et terne \r\nGrain : Le son est plut\u00f4t lisse au d\u00e9part puis rugueux \u00e0 la fin\r\nAllure : Pas de vibrato\r\nDynamique : Attaque douce et graduelle  \r\nProfil m\u00e9lodique : Variation serpentine\r\nProfil de masse : Site pour le son d'ambiance, qui apporte plus de profondeur. Calibre : pour l'\u00e9qualisation utilis\u00e9e pour nettoyer les fr\u00e9quences perturbatrices (sons ind\u00e9sirables) et mettre en avant les \u00e9l\u00e9ments voulus.",

I took a machine sound from my grandpa's workshop, overloaded it with flanger so it didn't even sound like a machine anymore, got a little snippet of the sound, pitch shifted it up, and repeated it, EQed it, and added some reverb. (The machine didn't have anything do do with it btw. You can do this with any sound.) Hope you guys enjoy this sound. Feel free to use this anywhere you want. :)",

The two other were samples from members of FreeSound community (credited in the properties of the file) were imported and remixed into the 2 generated tracks in layers at a different decibels.",

I was really happy with this, but I wanted it to be more distinct, that\u2019s why I used the graphic equalizer : boosting treble frequencies, and lowering basses frequencies. The trac kwas long enough, so I chose a few parts and cut out the rest.\n \nAfter all these modifications, the sound was too strong, thus I normalized my track (with the recommended settings) and got something more enjoyable. However, the saturation-like result was not exactly what I was looking for. In order to increase this back and forth movement while reducing the saturation, I applied a wah-wah effect, which resulted on the sound you\u2019re listening to. I just added a repetition to make it last a litte longer. \n\nIt was really fun to create. Trying different things, cancelling effects, adjusting measures \u2026 and finally get the sound you were looking for.",

I used aspergineering's Triumph Vitesse Drive as the main car traveling sound. this file is very short, so at times it may seem very suddel. Do look for the sequence that follows afterward! Hey guitarguy, thanks for that amazing synth firetruck sound! Loved it! I'll remaster it if you want.",

You hear a bit of traffic in the beginning, then 3 sirens, 2 background, one foreground. A neighbor's dog sings counterpoint. You can hear a common grackle as well at times. The sirens wind down and a bluejay starts up calling as the dog continues to howl. The test went on for over 3 minutes, a bit unusual that. Searching Google I found that some time ago Atchison got new 2001's and Eclipses to replace their old Thunderbolts and 2t22's. Maybe a siren expert will leave a comment and let us know which ones we heard.",

        "description": "An atmospheric alien like siren sound I made in FL Studio 20 using Sytrus. I made it mainly to practice and experiment with Sytrus. The sound itself was made using 5 of the 6 operators, the 3 filters and the reverb and chorus effect that are built-in Sytrus. All of the operators and the 3 filters are connected in some way to the X and Y modulation knobs. I then added a full rack of FX on the mixer like reverb, Maximus, Vocodex, Chorus, Etc... I also connected another rack of FX because the first one was full. I automated a bunch more stuff and this is basically the final result. Most of the FX on the racks are actually very subtle, it's just that there are a lot of them. \n\nYou may use this sound for your own project as long as you give credit.\n\nIf you ever do use this and post something online like a video, a music piece or anything else that contains it, I would be very interested in hearing/seeing it if you don't mind :)",

I copied-pasted the sound a few times to have something which sounds like kind of a siren. I reduced the volume by 6dB and reversed the direction of the copied-pasted sounds. Then, I used the cut function and the fade-in and fade-out effects to erase the \u00ab crack noises \u00bb and to obtain a smooth transition when the siren goes up or down. I finally added a reverb effect to feel like the siren is heard from an empty street.",

While waiting for trains this fire engine arrived in the area.  I decided to turn on the camcorder to get the sounds.*  BTW, my hand held scanner can be heard near the end so one may want to omit it if desired.  I also recorded this because the siren and horn sounded a bit like the Ward LaFrance fire engine seen in the 1970s TV show \"Emergency!\".    Yep, I'm that old!\n\n*Original audio taken from a Canon Vixia HFG40 camcorder with a Sony ECM-MS908C mic.  Audio edited with AVS audio editor.",
