More than that, I've been fixated on taking a single idea, and then applying as many permutations as I can to it. It is interesting to see how much variety can originate from a single source. This sample, as well as this pack in general is a testament to that. You have a simple drum beat, and then, I apply various effects then I iterate and continue ad nauseam.

For those who may care about the naming convention: each type of effect is labelled as FX###, and then each variation of parameters within that same effect is labelled by a following v###. Furthermore, if I decide to get ambitious I may iterated the same exact effect with the same parameters again (and again...), I indicate the number of iterations in the name of the track as well. And when I get super ambitious I may chain together effects, and then I indicate the ""infra-effect"" with an additional v### to indicate that I'm applying different effects to a single instance of a particular effect.

Anyway, enough of the monotonous stuff.

I hope you enjoy this stuff, I hope you can use it in your own work and that perhaps it sparks something in your mind about the power of iteration, change, and the unity that lies under the diverse manifestation of sound.

More than that, I've been fixated on taking a single idea, and then applying as many permutations as I can to it. It is interesting to see how much variety can originate from a single source. This sample, as well as this pack in general is a testament to that. You have a simple drum beat, and then, I apply various effects then I iterate and continue ad nauseam.

For those who may care about the naming convention: each type of effect is labelled as FX###, and then each variation of parameters within that same effect is labelled by a following v###. Furthermore, if I decide to get ambitious I may iterated the same exact effect with the same parameters again (and again...), I indicate the number of iterations in the name of the track as well. And when I get super ambitious I may chain together effects, and then I indicate the ""infra-effect"" with an additional v### to indicate that I'm applying different effects to a single instance of a particular effect.

For those who may care about the naming convention: each type of effect is labelled as FX###, and then each variation of parameters within that same effect is labelled by a following v###. Furthermore, if I decide to get ambitious I may iterated the same exact effect with the same parameters again (and again...), I indicate the number of iterations in the name of the track as well.

Furthermore, if I decide to get ambitious I may iterated the same exact effect with the same parameters again (and again...), I indicate the number of iterations in the name of the track as well. And when I get super ambitious I may chain together effects, and then I indicate the ""infra-effect"" with an additional v### to indicate that I'm applying different effects to a single instance of a particular effect.

Anyway, enough of the monotonous stuff.

I used the Funk HQ drum pack samples.

The beat is played at 160 BPM and I have presented to you the clean (unedited version) and then I have used Audacity to add effects.

Each effect has multiple tweaked versions and I labelled these tracks accordingly.
As with all the tracks, feel free to use them, manipulate them, do whatever you wish to them for any projects you may have. I just ask that you provide credit and attribution by providing a link and citing me, Hewn.Marrow as the original creator of the sample.

More than that, I've been fixated on taking a single idea, and then applying as many permutations as I can to it. It is interesting to see how much variety can originate from a single source. This sample, as well as this pack in general is a testament to that. You have a simple drum beat, and then, I apply various effects then I iterate and continue ad nauseam.

For those who may care about the naming convention: each type of effect is labelled as FX###, and then each variation of parameters within that same effect is labelled by a following v###. Furthermore, if I decide to get ambitious I may iterated the same exact effect with the same parameters again (and again...), I indicate the number of iterations in the name of the track as well. And when I get super ambitious I may chain together effects, and then I indicate the ""infra-effect"" with an additional v### to indicate that I'm applying different effects to a single instance of a particular effect.

This sample, as well as this pack in general is a testament to that. You have a simple drum beat, and then, I apply various effects then I iterate and continue ad nauseam.

For those who may care about the naming convention: each type of effect is labelled as FX###, and then each variation of parameters within that same effect is labelled by a following v###. Furthermore, if I decide to get ambitious I may iterated the same exact effect with the same parameters again (and again...), I indicate the number of iterations in the name of the track as well. And when I get super ambitious I may chain together effects, and then I indicate the ""infra-effect"" with an additional v### to indicate that I'm applying different effects to a single instance of a particular effect.

Anyway, enough of the monotonous stuff.

For those who may care about the naming convention: each type of effect is labelled as FX###, and then each variation of parameters within that same effect is labelled by a following v###.

I used the Funk HQ drum pack samples.

The beat is played at 160 BPM and I have presented to you the clean (unedited version) and then I have used Audacity to add effects.

Each effect has multiple tweaked versions and I labelled these tracks accordingly.
As with all the tracks, feel free to use them, manipulate them, do whatever you wish to them for any projects you may have. I just ask that you provide credit and attribution by providing a link and citing me, Hewn.Marrow as the original creator of the sample.

More than that, I've been fixated on taking a single idea, and then applying as many permutations as I can to it. It is interesting to see how much variety can originate from a single source. This sample, as well as this pack in general is a testament to that. You have a simple drum beat, and then, I apply various effects then I iterate and continue ad nauseam.

For those who may care about the naming convention: each type of effect is labelled as FX###, and then each variation of parameters within that same effect is labelled by a following v###. Furthermore, if I decide to get ambitious I may iterated the same exact effect with the same parameters again (and again...), I indicate the number of iterations in the name of the track as well. And when I get super ambitious I may chain together effects, and then I indicate the ""infra-effect"" with an additional v### to indicate that I'm applying different effects to a single instance of a particular effect.

Anyway, enough of the monotonous stuff.

More than that, I've been fixated on taking a single idea, and then applying as many permutations as I can to it. It is interesting to see how much variety can originate from a single source. This sample, as well as this pack in general is a testament to that. You have a simple drum beat, and then, I apply various effects then I iterate and continue ad nauseam.

For those who may care about the naming convention: each type of effect is labelled as FX###, and then each variation of parameters within that same effect is labelled by a following v###. Furthermore, if I decide to get ambitious I may iterated the same exact effect with the same parameters again (and again...), I indicate the number of iterations in the name of the track as well. And when I get super ambitious I may chain together effects, and then I indicate the ""infra-effect"" with an additional v### to indicate that I'm applying different effects to a single instance of a particular effect.

Anyway, enough of the monotonous stuff.

I hope you enjoy this stuff, I hope you can use it in your own work and that perhaps it sparks something in your mind about the power of iteration, change, and the unity that lies under the diverse manifestation of sound.

All I ask is that if you do use any of this in your work at all, to cite me as the origin of the samples, you can cite me, Hewn.Marrow by linking <a href=""https://freesound.org/people/Hewn.Marrow/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://freesound.org/people/Hewn.Marrow/</a>.

More than that, I've been fixated on taking a single idea, and then applying as many permutations as I can to it. It is interesting to see how much variety can originate from a single source. This sample, as well as this pack in general is a testament to that. You have a simple drum beat, and then, I apply various effects then I iterate and continue ad nauseam.

For those who may care about the naming convention: each type of effect is labelled as FX###, and then each variation of parameters within that same effect is labelled by a following v###. Furthermore, if I decide to get ambitious I may iterated the same exact effect with the same parameters again (and again...), I indicate the number of iterations in the name of the track as well. And when I get super ambitious I may chain together effects, and then I indicate the ""infra-effect"" with an additional v### to indicate that I'm applying different effects to a single instance of a particular effect.

Anyway, enough of the monotonous stuff.

I hope you enjoy this stuff, I hope you can use it in your own work and that perhaps it sparks something in your mind about the power of iteration, change, and the unity that lies under the diverse manifestation of sound.

All I ask is that if you do use any of this in your work at all, to cite me as the origin of the samples, you can cite me, Hewn.Marrow by linking <a href=""https://freesound.org/people/Hewn.Marrow/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://freesound.org/people/Hewn.Marrow/</a>.

More than that, I've been fixated on taking a single idea, and then applying as many permutations as I can to it. It is interesting to see how much variety can originate from a single source. This sample, as well as this pack in general is a testament to that. You have a simple drum beat, and then, I apply various effects then I iterate and continue ad nauseam.

For those who may care about the naming convention: each type of effect is labelled as FX###, and then each variation of parameters within that same effect is labelled by a following v###. Furthermore, if I decide to get ambitious I may iterated the same exact effect with the same parameters again (and again...), I indicate the number of iterations in the name of the track as well. And when I get super ambitious I may chain together effects, and then I indicate the ""infra-effect"" with an additional v### to indicate that I'm applying different effects to a single instance of a particular effect.

Anyway, enough of the monotonous stuff.

I hope you enjoy this stuff, I hope you can use it in your own work and that perhaps it sparks something in your mind about the power of iteration, change, and the unity that lies under the diverse manifestation of sound.

All I ask is that if you do use any of this in your work at all, to cite me as the origin of the samples, you can cite me, Hewn.Marrow by linking <a href=""https://freesound.org/people/Hewn.Marrow/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://freesound.org/people/Hewn.Marrow/</a>.
