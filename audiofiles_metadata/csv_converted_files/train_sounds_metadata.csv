I started recording sounds when the train was slowing down to the second station, Pillangó utca, and the recording is ended when the train was arrived to the station 'Blaha'. If you use train simulator, you have MP3 editor and you are looking for sound effects, you may find some.This is a good chance for me to made this recording because the train always move fastly and very rarely stops in the tunnel between two stations.At the first minute when the train arrived to 'Pillangó utca' the CP engine was on and it is ideal looping sound effect. Going into the deep at 1:40, the train is going very slowly into the tunnel. At 2:16 There is another train which is going fastly on the backward railway in the tunnel. It has great echo sounds. The sound is an ideal looping sound for slow-moving, I think. At 2:48 the train was accelerating a bit and you can hear cleanly the looping motor sound. at 3:23 the train stopped in the tunnel for 20 seconds, then arrived to station Stadionok. At 4:33 it is moving to the next station, Keleti Pályaudvar. I like hearing at 4:47 and 4:55 at any time when it is going onto the rail-crossings. The station Keleti Pályaudvar is much deeper then the station Stadionok. You cannot hear the motor sounds of the train. This is a good looping example for fast-moving sound. When the train was arrived at the station the CP engine was started again and you can hear it almost clearly.",https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,485.918,"{'preview-hq-mp3': 'https://cdn.freesound.org/previews/44/44411_197070-hq.mp3', 'preview-hq-ogg': 'https://cdn.freesound.org/previews/44/44411_197070-hq.ogg', 'preview-lq-mp3': 'https://cdn.freesound.org/previews/44/44411_197070-lq.mp3', 'preview-lq-ogg': 'https://cdn.freesound.org/previews/44/44411_197070-lq.ogg'}"

sample pack. 
The three samples in this series were recorded simultaneously (from
approximately the same position) with three different standard stereo
microphone arrangements: mid-side (mixed into L-R), X-Y cardioid, and
with a Jecklin disk.

The 5'34"" recordings capture a long freight train (with a helicopter
flying overhead) passing approximately 10 feet in front of the
microphones (from left to right) in Berkeley, California (USA) on
September 17, 2006.

This recording was made with a pair of Sennheiser MKH-800
microphones in a mid-side configuration (inside a Rycote blimp).
The ""mid"" microphone was set to ""wide cardioid"" and the ""side""
was set to ""figure-8"", with the array connected to a Sound Devices 744T
digital recorder at 96K/24bits.  Mixed into conventional A-B stereo in Logic Pro.

I recorded this sound in a train between stations Kozarovce - Nova bana (Slovakia). When the train passes through the track between those stations, passengers can hear sound, similar to braking truck. One friend told me the story behind this mysterious sound: Once upon a time, overnight express crashed to the truck in the rail crossing which is located between those stations. The truck was destroyed because train pushed the truck a few hundred meters away. The driver was dead and his body was not buried in its entirety. His spirit settled there and passengers have to listen to a sound of braking truck. Railwaymen supposedly rebuilded this part of a track, but the sound didn't disappear.
you can hear two different sounds. First is on a track between Nova Bana - Kozarovce, second is in the same truck but in return path. Recorded with Zoom H1 internal mic.

Sound memories of José Maria Marquez.
In Barceloneta had two large companies which now no longer exist: ""El Vulcano"", where ships repaired, at the end of the ride, and ""La Maquinista"" where did the trains.
In Maquinista street train passed. Those who went to work in the city had to jump the train because he was standing too long
In the market square there was a civil guard barracks.
José tells us an accident that happened to the tram of Pueblo Nuevo - 36. This tram one morning collided with a train, and to not see the disaster train blocked the newspaper papers.
There was also the manufacture of gas, ""La Catalana"" where demonstrations were made to remove it.
Interview recorded in the framework of the Memoria Sonoria activities of the project Barceloneta Sonora.

To make this sound, I recorded different sliding doors, wardrobes, cupboards etc. to get the slide of the train door and then for the opening of the door I recorded the steel door on my garage, which was really useful in getting the colossal size of the door. 

This sound can be used in any context, but I found this sounds better if it was used in the context of a sliding train door from the 1940's, like I used it for, or if you had a film with a huge metal container and you needed the sound of the opening of the container door. I will upload the sound of just the clang of the door if that's suits everyone better.

(Moscow, Saint-Petersburg, Kyiv, Budapest, Prague, Warsaw, and Sofia metros, to name a few). 
This is produced by the BPSN-5U2 converter (BPSN stands for auxiliary power supply block), a set of two static inverters that convert 750V (or 825V) DC from the third rail to 80V DC for the onboard control systems in the cabin, and 220V AC for the interior lights. One of the converters produces a 300Hz tone, the other produces a 200Hz tone. On later trains, the 200Hz tone is inaudible due to the replacement of the secondary inverter.
Later 81-717 trains have had these power supplies replaced with quieter BPSN-5U2M or BBE units, or by completely silent BPN-115 and DIP power supplies.

These are several variants of the sound, as heard in different cities.

No theory, that is for wikipedia, not that I am a 'know it all'. 

<b>sound and distance</b>
We 'take the train' as subject for this lesson. 4 recordings of a train passing a steel bridge. We double the distance to the train every recording; 100m 200m 400m and 800m. 

What are the changes: 
1] The further you are from the subject (train) the better you hear the background.
2] The closer you are on the subject (train) the better you hear the higher frequency's of it.
Listen a hundred times, take your recorder and try this yourselves.

And yes there is a lot more, but maybe that on an other lesson.
What difference do you hear more?
Give your comment.

<b>Tip of the day</b>: The success of a good (field-)recording is in the first few seconds.

To hear you first have to listen

You can ear at the background  in the beginning the sound of the railroad gates bells ringing, a rooster, 2 different sets of birds and a dog barking constantly. There is also some noise created by my feet as I step in the gravel between the tracks.

Compare the sound in one and the same location. One recording is from May 2019 and the other from May 2020. One recording is without covid19. The other is during covid19.

<b>How I did compare;</b>
On May 13, 2019 I made an audio recording from thirteen minutes past seven in the evening.
On May 4, 2020, I made a sound recording at the same time of the evening.
I put these two tracks together exactly in time in Audacity.
<b>I adjusted the sound level of each track to the sparks that the electric trains make when they pass from one energy network to another. That is precisely in front of the microphone.</b>
Then I looked where the quietest parts of both sound recordings coincided. I used these three minutes for the comparison.
In this audio file you hear the sound change every fifteen seconds.
The audio file starts with the corona-free part in 2019.

Both original audio files can be found below.

First, I recorded a sound of a spoon turning in an empty cup of tea during 7sec. 
Then, I tried to play with the rhythm of the sound : I copy-pasted this sound 7 times under the principal track and I shifted all the copies with the tool ""time slip"" with different shift (before or after the principal track). After that, I mixed all the tracks in one.

To get this sound more realistic, I changed the pitch of the track (-10) and added a reverb (7%).
