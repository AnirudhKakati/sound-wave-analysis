<b>Caution! The opening is very quiet. If you turn up the volume to anything more than a level that would give a good rendition of normal symphonic orchestral music, some of the later birdsong will be uncomfortably loud. Also, please note that, like any <em>full</em> dawn chorus, it's very much for those people with long attention span — especially during the first half-hour, by which time the unfolding of the chorus is noticeably accelerating.</b>

This is one of four widely separated concurrent recordings that I made during the pre-dawn to early morning period on 1 June 2019, sheltered from an initially moderate but decreasing south-westerly breeze by self-seeded Sitka spruce trees outside the forestry perimeter on the west flank of Bellever Tor, near Postbridge, on Dartmoor, Devon, UK. 

As I explain in detail on my page <i><b><a href=""https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/all-night-recording-sessions.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">The inspiring frisson of an all-night recording session alone in the wilds</a></b></i>, this session was the all-night 'final performance' &#8212; the culmination of my series of test and then 'rehearsal' recordings, which was underscored by detailed prospecting for optimal recorder placements, which were aimed towards my doing a greatly improved version of the previous year's somewhat blighted all-night session here, again for birds' full evening and dawn choruses, including nightjar choruses and plenty of cuckoo sound.

Whereas in the 'dress rehearsal' for this session (evening / dusk, 14 May) all four recorders had been placed around the west / north-west flank of Bellever Tor, this time I wanted to increase their scope, so only two recorders were placed there, the other two being placed further north, more away from the tor, both just inside the edge of regrowing forestry. Ideally they'd have been just outside, in the clearing that runs very roughly northwards from Bellever Tor (particularly to capture nightjars, and, hopefully, skylarks), but there were no self-seeded Sitka spruce trees there to shelter the recorders, so I placed them as close to the main clearing as possible.

This recording is from my recorder labelled R6, at the most southerly position used in this session. I left it and the others running all night, to ensure that nothing important would be missed. Nightjars and cuckoos don't have much of an 'off' period in the short nights of this time of year, and there might always be something unexpected of interest in the middle of the night.

In the event, although the nightjars gave only a late and sparse performance for the recorders in the evening part of the session, they did much better for the pre-dawn into dawn period. This recording gets a pretty good showing of that, especially considering the constraints imposed by having to have the recorder sheltered from the breeze. This is a beautifully atmospheric effect, especially with the punctuations from occasional cuckoo episodes. Those cuckoos echo / reverberate really nicely in the dense stand of forestry to west (on the left round to rather behind).

However, there is a disappointment, in that the nightjars, apart from a single one that gave a performance near the recorder, are all sufficiently distant that they're difficult to hear from really good speakers, even though I can hear them quite distinctly (albeit mostly very quiet) on my Audio-Technica ATH-M50x headphones. If you want to hear a more distinct nightjar chorus, the best place I can offer currently is <a href=""https://freesound.org/people/Philip_Goddard/sounds/662282/"" rel=""nofollow"">the concurrent recording by R4</a> in that session.

Also, later in the recording certain birds, especially willow warbler, sang a bit too close, and that forced me to reduce their level somewhat for tolerably comfortable listening. That processing in turn causes a slight dip in the background sound during those brief reduced peaks.

There are more gaps between the trees than is evident in this view. The recorder is facing the quite wide gap between the trees on left and the left-most of the trees behind, and it has an open wide panorama to west &#8212; i.e., in this direction, towards the stand of forestry that gives us the echoes / reverbs from the cuckoos and indeed occasionally cattle. Those effects would thus all be heard on the left side of the recording.</i>

<b>Techie stuff:</b>
The recorder was a Sony PCM-D100, unusually with just one furry windshield (Windcut, custom), and it was placed on a Hama normal-size lightweight tripod.

Initial post-recording processing was to apply an EQ curve to compensate for muffling from the furry windshield, and the dynamic compressor VST plugin <i><b>TDR Kotelnikov</b></i> to reduce the level of some over-obliging birds that came to sing too close to the recorder &#8212; always a hazard when one relies on trees to give shelter to the recorder!

Although I consistently failed get acceptable results with Kotelnikov or indeed other compressors for dealing with lightning strikes or firework displays (transient weird balance where a sudden loud sound is tamed), I find the results with over-loud birds relatively effective and transparent, though where there is noticeable continuous background sound I do notice a gentle dip in that sound coinciding with the reduced peaks, which isn't at all ideal but at least is better than having those birds so disproportionately and uncomfortably loud.

This is one of four widely separated concurrent recordings that I made on the evening of 14 May 2019, sheltered from a stiff easterly breeze by self-seeded Sitka spruce trees outside the forestry perimeter on the north-west flank of Bellever Tor, near Postbridge, on Dartmoor, Devon, UK. The breeze eased off a fair bit gradually during the evening.

As I explain in detail on my page <b><a href=""https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/all-night-recording-sessions.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">The inspiring frisson of an all-night recording session alone in the wilds</a></b>, this session was a step in my series of 'rehearsal' test recordings, underscored by detailed prospecting for optimal recorder placements, which were aimed towards my doing a greatly improved version of the previous year's somewhat blighted all-night session here, again for birds' full evening and dawn choruses, including nightjar choruses and plenty of cuckoo sound.

Seeing this session in retrospective context, it's conveniently regarded as the 'dress rehearsal' for the 'final performance' that came on the night of 31 May to 1 June. However, cold conditions forced me to abandon this session as it was getting dark, so I was unable to stay for the dawn chorus.

All four recordings were made in the shelter of self-seeded Sitka spruce trees close to the forestry perimeter, on the Bellever Tor side. This recording is from the most northerly position, close to where a minor unofficial track branches off from the rough forestry perimeter track, leading SSE up to Bellever Tor summit.

As I noted in my journal, ""Some cuckoos did sound during the recordings, mostly early on &#8212; but no real star performances.&#160; I heard no blackbirds, apart from the odd distant hint of one when I was on the tor, and briefly heard a song thrush and the odd willow warbler.&#160; No nightjars.&#160; There seemed to be altogether too little birdsong to make worthwhile recordings.""

It was therefore a great pleasure when I came to audition and edit the recordings, to find that they had each captured quite a lot of bird activity. Indeed, surprisingly, this particular recording had <em>too much</em> blackbird, would you believe! In particular, there was an insufferable period of some 23 minutes with this particular blackbird very close and thus uncomfortably loud, and very persistent. I rebelled and cut out 20 minutes of that, because one couldn't listen to anything much else in that time. I haven't cut that out of the original, but I did it to the copy to post here, to spare you nice listeners such purgatory &#8212; and I say that as a great lover of blackbird song generally!

The name is derived from *Šikovľ(an)e, probably based on the root *šik- (cf. Slovene šikara 'thicket, bushes' and Kostel dialect šikara 'steep area difficult to access'), referring to a local geographical feature. According to the latest data from 2020, it has 310 inhabitants.

Distant birds (including occasional cuckoo calls), occasional sheep bleating, the constant distant sound of the River Taw tumbling over boulders in the stream bed &#8212; its sound strangely dispersed over the hillside beyond, thanks to a constant echo off all the boulders on that slope. The most prominent bird overall sounds a bit like a blackbird to the 'newbie' (that was me, at that time!), but is really a mistle thrush.</b>

I made this recording on 26 May 2013, concurrently with another at roughly the same height but a very few minutes' walk in the downstream direction (approx. north). You can hear that one at <a href=""https://freesound.org/people/Philip_Goddard/sounds/699679/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://freesound.org/people/Philip_Goddard/sounds/699679/</a> .

This one has an interesting difference of situation. Whereas that one is on a very open and relatively uniform slope, this one is among larger boulders at the foot of a patch of very bouldery steeper slope, which is behind the recorder. In acoustic terms that's quite a big deal, because here the distant sounds all seem closer and more 'present', so this soundscape gains in 'presence' and clarity of everything, but loses a little of the almost other-worldly spaciousness and vastness of the other recording.

<b>Advisory</b>

High-grade headphones are recommended in order to hear all the detail.

<b>Techie stuff:</b>
The recorder was a Sony PCM-M10, with one furry windshield &#8212; a R&#248;de DeadKitten (original, more effective, version) &#8212;, and placed on a Hama Mini tripod, which I regard as tiny rather than just mini!

Post-recording processing was to apply EQ in Audacity to correct for the muffling effect of the windshield, and more recent processing with the A1 Stereo Control VST plugin (160% widening).

To put myself back there on that night for writing these notes, I'm in touch again with the power and 'electricity' of that night's experience, with shivers up the spine and near-tearfulness that this was all really happening, and not just a dream sent to torment me with the waking-up. &#8212; But this is the spot for the basic info, and a fuller, more contextual, account (connecting with a big and convoluted personal story), is to be found at my page <i><b><a href=""https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/all-night-recording-sessions.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">The inspiring frisson of an all-night recording session out in the wilds</a></b></i>.</p>
<p>I made this recording as part of an all-night recording session on 18-19 June 2014. The exact location was at a carefully chosen spot on the top of the precipitous crag known as Sharp Tor, beside the Hunter's Path, Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK, quite near the well-known Castle Drogo.</p>That is nearly a kilometre to west of Hunting Gate, where I made <a href=""https://freesound.org/people/Philip_Goddard/sounds/656898/"" rel=""nofollow"">my other, concurrent dawn chorus recording</a>.<br>
<p>This is a somewhat less quiet panorama than that one, because we're lower down, less distant from the River Teign and the birds in the lower part of the valley. The river is louder here too because of some rapids below, and also some sound is presumably being picked up from Drogo Weir, a little further upstream.</p>
<p>Another difference is how the two choruses start. Here, prior to the main chorus, we hear a gentle (i.e., fairly distant) ensemble of nightjars. These are persistent, and form a foundation for the build-up of the main chorus, gradually getting buried in it and quietly bowing out, leaving it to the others to continue building this uplifting symphony. The kick-off of the start of the main chorus comes from robins, not song-thrush as in the Hunting Gate recording.</p><img alt=""The Sharp Tor crag, looking west from Hunter's path"" src=""https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/140619_sharp_tor_from_hunters_path,_v-early_morning.jpg""><br><em>The Sharp Tor crag, from the Hunter's path just to the east of it. The arrow points to the recorder on its tripod, which is clearly visible in the full-resolution version of this image, while the little patch of valley fog is in the Chagford area, and high Dartmoor forms the distant skyline.</em><br>
<p><b>Because of this being a primarily distant and thus quiet panorama, it's <em>NOT</em> a good idea to turn the volume up beyond a sensible <em>normal</em> setting. If you do so, you would certainly hear still more detail, but that would not be as I was hearing it, and also you'd find the occasional really close bird song very uncomfortably loud.</b></p>
<p><b>The techie stuff:</b><br>I took with me two Sony PCM-M10 recorders, so I could record two concurrent dawn choruses, some distance apart (in the event, nearly a kilometre apart). Actually I started this recording about 1.30 a.m. BST, but this edited version starts probably about 3.45. The recorders were each fitted with a R&#248;de DeadKitten furry windshield (the original, more effective, light grey version).</p>
<p>I placed the one for this recording perched on top of the Sharp Tor crag just by the seat, so it was just as well it was night and nobody was going to come here to sit and admire the non-view! The recorder was on a diminutive Hama Mini Tripod (something I'd not use nowadays, especially as the PCM-D100 recorder is really to heavy for it). It took me quite some time to find the likely best spot among the irregularities on the crag-top.</p>
<p>The point was that I realized that much of the birdsong would be more or less distant, and that the sound of the River Teign here, as one would normally hear it, would mask quite a bit of that birdsong. So, the name of the game was to get an optimal balance between minimizing the river sound by bringing the recorder back from the absolute top prominences, and maximizing exposure to the distant birdsong by bringing it forward, to overlook the bottom of the valley.</p>
<p>This involved my having to keep getting down into funny positions to try to assess the river sound as heard at the level of the recorder on that tiny tripod. As there was virtually no birdsong then, I could work only on the basis of the river sound &#8212; which meant in practice having to imagine the distant birdsong while I listened to the river sound at recorder level, and choose the minimum distance back from the edge that reduced the river sound just enough, set against my imaginary distant dawn chorus. Surely at least somebody out there will agree with me that I did a bloody good job in taking that little bit of trouble! <img src=""https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif""></p><img alt=""The recorder just waiting for me to take it down"" src=""https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/140619_recording_dawn_chorus_sharptor_teigng.jpg""><br><i>The recorder just waiting for me to take it down, having done a brilliant job!</i><br>
<p>Initial post-recording processing was to apply an EQ curve to compensate for muffling from the furry windshield, but much more recently I used the <i><b>A1 Stereo Control</b></i> VST plugin to widen and dramatically sharpen-up the appalling stereo imaging of the PCM-M10. That distinctly over-brightened each recording it was let loose on, and I rectified that by applying <strong>an EQ tilt as follows: a straight line from 100Hz (no change) to 8K (-7dB)</strong><strong></strong>. That then required a little compensatory level amplification (usually +3dB, but varied according to each recording).</p>
<p>But then I realized I couldn't use this recording with that processing, because the river sound heard through speakers had nasty phasey effects and phase cancellation areas in the soundstage &#8212; an effect you don't get when listening with headphones. About to wail and gnash, I tried processing another copy of the recording with half the amount of the widening. Although I could still just hear that phasiness effect, it was much less prominent and I reckoned not enough to spoil one's listening. That required about half the amount of EQ tilt (to -3dB) and the compensatory level lift (typically 1.5dB), and got me altogether more natural and better-balanced sound. </p>

Bird sounds from my garden and adjoining woods around dawn this morning, notably a woodpecker pecking wood.
Other sounds - cat meowing at me (back, near start), airliner (back left to front right ~10km+,), pigeon flapping wings (inc. up, towards end), train (right ~2km.), scafolding? being moved, and some traffic (right ~1km.) Woods mainly front and left, house and hillside behind, town right (1-2km.),slightly down.
Very demanding soundstage to reproduce with wide range of distances, directions, and frequency bands. Some sounds have very limited bandwidth (eg. HF air attenuation at 1Km.+ ) making localization more tricky. Good test for headphone imaging.
Best on headphones, but works quite well on stereo speakers.

Unfortunately there is some audible hiss from new aux. mics, if played too loud.

This is an odd recording, which came out differently to how I'd intended.

What we hear of the sea, on the left, is actually almost all echo and not direct sea sound. As the skylark chorus becomes more sporadic, so other landlubber birds make appearance too, such as meadow pipit and linnet.</b>

This actually all-night recording session had a rather involved little story behind it, and to save me repeating myself here, you can read about that in the notes for my full skylark dawn chorus recording, <b><a href=""https://freesound.org/people/Philip_Goddard/sounds/667643/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://freesound.org/people/Philip_Goddard/sounds/667643/</a></b>.

What's really odd about how this recording came out is that I had the recorder on top of the drystone wall, <i>squarely facing into the field</i>, to maximize the skylarks' sound and downplay the sea sound, and yet, weirdly, the resulting recording sounds for all the world as though the recorder had been facing <i>along</i> the wall, with field-related sounds generally on the right and sea-related sounds on the left. I still don't understand how it worked out like that.

I deliberately chose a position where almost all the (gentle) sea action was out of sight, so that its sound would be subdued and reasonably balanced with the birdsong over the field. Hence nearly all of what we do hear of it is echo from the cliffs that we can see from there.

The main seabirds we hear at times are herring gull (of course!), and, less frequently, great black-backed gull (imagine a ponderous version of herring gull calls, with an excruciatingly laryngitic voice!), with occasional brief piping calls of the odd oystercatchers.

Note the drystone wall just visible top right, which continues just a little back from cliff edge towards The Rumps, being the boundary of pasture fields where skylarks deliver beautiful choruses.
I made this recording further along, much nearer The Rumps.</i>

<img alt=""The rugged clifftop and drystone wall towards The Rumps"" src=""https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/120923_rugged_clifftop_near_the_rumps_01.jpg"">
<i>Note how the drystone wall winds its way next to the Coast Path (the latter on this side), bounding the 'skylark-rich' pasture fields. Further along, as path and wall near The Rumps, the wall bears right, still with the path beside it, but the official Coast Path turns off, bearing a little left, passing through a well-vegetated disused quarry area.
It was there that I placed my R4 recorder for this recording &#8212; actually on top of the wall, so it faced into the field, with its back to the sea. Crazily, I didn't take any photos there, which is why all I can do is describe the spot.

<b>Techie stuff:</b>
The recorder was a Sony PCM-D100, with three furry windshields (Windcut, custom), and it was placed on a Zipshot Mini tripod.

Post-recording processing was to apply an EQ curve to compensate for muffling from the furry windshields, and, much more recently, noise reduction in Audacity was used to reduce somewhat the microphone self-noise (full frequency, not just the hiss).

Cuckoos periodically echoing / reverberating in the dense stands of the spruces not far off, and we're treated to a half-hour quiet nightjar chorus plus a lone melancholy-sounding distant cuckoo leading us in ever so gradually&#8230;</b>

<b>Caution! The opening is very quiet. If you turn up the volume to anything more than a level that would give a good rendition of normal symphonic orchestral music, some of the later birdsong will be uncomfortably loud.</b>

This is one of four widely separated concurrent recordings that I made during the pre-dawn to early morning period on 1 June 2019, sheltered from an initially moderate but decreasing south-westerly breeze by self-seeded Sitka spruce trees outside the forestry perimeter on the north-west flank of Bellever Tor, near Postbridge, on Dartmoor, Devon, UK. 

As I explain in detail on my page <b><i><a href=""https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/all-night-recording-sessions.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">The inspiring frisson of an all-night recording session alone in the wilds</a></i></b>, this session was the all-night 'final performance' &#8212; the culmination of my series of test and then 'rehearsal' recordings, which was underscored by detailed prospecting for optimal recorder placements, which were aimed towards my doing a greatly improved version of the previous year's somewhat blighted all-night session here, again for birds' full evening and dawn choruses, including nightjar choruses and plenty of cuckoo sound.

Whereas in the 'dress rehearsal' for this session (evening / dusk, 14 May) all four recorders had been placed around the west / north-west flank of Bellever Tor, this time I wanted to increase their scope, so only two recorders were placed there, the other two being placed further north, more away from the tor, both just inside the edge of regrowing forestry.

Ideally they'd have been just outside, in the clearing that runs very roughly northwards from Bellever Tor (particularly to capture nightjars, and, hopefully, skylarks), but there were no self-seeded Sitka spruce trees there to shelter the recorders, so I placed them as close to the main clearing as possible while keeping them sufficiently sheltered.

This recording is from my recorder labelled R4, at the most northerly position, just a little north of where the drystone wall that crosses the main clearing crosses the forestry perimeter, and, as I say, it was sheltered just within the regrowing forestry. I left it and the others running all night, to ensure that nothing important would be missed. Nightjars and cuckoos don't have much of an 'off' period in the short nights of this time of year, and there might always be something unexpected of interest in the middle of the night.

In the event, although the nightjars gave only a late and sparse performance for the recorders in the evening part of the session, they did much better for the pre-dawn into dawn period. This recording gets a pretty good showing of that, especially considering the constraints imposed by having to have the recorder sheltered from the breeze. This is a beautifully atmospheric effect, especially with the punctuations from occasional cuckoo episodes.

Those cuckoos echo / reverberate really nicely, but that effect is not from the dense stand of spruces west of Bellever Tor, but from the same on and in vicinity of Lakehead Hill, a little NNW of this spot.

<b>Techie stuff:</b>
The recorder was a Sony PCM-D100, unusually with just one furry windshield (Windcut, custom), and it was placed on a Hama normal-size lightweight tripod.

Initial post-recording processing was to apply an EQ curve to compensate for muffling from the furry windshield, and applying dynamic EQ using the VST plugin TDR Nova GE with a custom preset to greatly minimize the odd bits of wind disturbance that did occur.

To put myself back there on that night for writing these notes, I'm in touch again with the power and 'electricity' of that night's experience, with shivers up the spine and near-tearfulness that this was all really happening, and not just a dream sent to torment me with the waking-up. &#8212; But this is the spot for the basic info, and a fuller, more contextual, account (connecting with a big and convoluted personal story), is to be found at my page <i><b><a href=""https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/all-night-recording-sessions.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">The inspiring frisson of an all-night recording session out in the wilds</a></b></i>.

I made this recording as part of an all-night recording session on 18-19 June 2014. The exact location was just slightly east of Hunting Gate, the highest point on the Hunter's Path, Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK.

To convey as much as possible of the full dawn chorus experience, I've included a quite long 'lead-in' period, where you hear just the distant rushing of the River Teign down below in the valley, now and again a very faint tweet or twitter from some little birdie just wondering whether it's time to get up yet. &#8212; And then, ever so quietly, a distant nightjar starts churring on and off, before finally a song thrush down in the valley puts its head above the parapets, so to speak, and gives the cue for the other songbirds (initially mostly song-thrush and some robins) to start phasing in with their serenades, then with the odd yellowhammers and of course blackbirds piling in.

Occasionally a male pheasant fairly nearby makes a rather startling transient disturbance, particularly once things have got going properly, though it did that once or twice before I started this recording.

By some half-hour in, a mind-boggling number of blackbirds are singing &#8212; mostly distant &#8212; always punctuated by other species of course. How could any well-functioning human not absolutely love and exalt in such multitudinous, celebratory-sounding, blackbird choruses?!

Note that this is basically a distant and thus nearly all quiet panorama, facing across the deep, steep-sided valley, in a heathland clearing between patches of valley-slope copse and woodland. The other side of the valley is more consistently wooded &#8212; in fact largely forestry plantation, containing mostly conifer but some patches of broadleaved trees.

<b>Advisory</b>
Because of this being a primarily distant and thus quiet panorama, it's <em>NOT</em> a good idea to turn the volume up beyond a sensible <em>normal</em> setting. If you do so, you would certainly hear still more detail, but that would not be as I was hearing it, and also you'd find the occasional really close bird song very uncomfortably loud.

<em>The more western (upstream) part of the recording's panorama. The little patch of valley fog is in the Chagford area, and high Dartmoor forms the distant skyline.</em>

<b>The techie stuff:</b>
I took with me two Sony PCM-M10 recorders, so I could record two concurrent dawn choruses, some distance apart (in the event, nearly a kilometre apart). Actually I started this recording about 2.30 a.m. BST, but what's on this final, edited version starts at about 3.50, with the distant 'kick-off' twitterings of a song thrush down in the bottom of the valley insinuating themselves into one's awareness from about 8 minutes in. The recorders were each fitted with a R&#248;de DeadKitten furry windshield (the original, more effective, light grey version).

I placed the one for this recording perched rather precariously as you can see in the photo, by means of a GorillaPod, just east of a line of copse running down the valley slope from Hunting Gate. I'd been thinking of placing it within the copse, but realized that the foliage close around would blur fine / distant detail in the soundscape, so chose to put it in the clearing just to the east, but still near enough to to the copse to benefit from some foreground birds singing from the trees there. &#8212; The irony of course was that for some arcane reason, in the event hardly any birds sang from there, so the recorded soundscape was mostly a distant one.

<img alt=""The recorder just waiting for me to take it down"" src=""https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/140619_recording_dawn_chorus_huntinggate_teigng.jpg"">
<i>The recorder just waiting for me to take it down, having done a brilliant job!</i>

Initial post-recording processing was to apply an EQ curve to compensate for muffling from the furry windshield, but much more recently I used the <i><b>A1 Stereo Control</b></i> VST plugin to widen and dramatically sharpen-up the appalling stereo imaging of the PCM-M10. That distinctly over-brightened each recording it was let loose on, and I rectified that by applying <strong>an EQ tilt as follows: a straight line from 100Hz (no change) to 8K (-7dB)</strong>. That then required a little compensatory level amplification (usually +3dB, but varied according to each recording).

&#8230; And a reminder, that there's fuller, more contextual account of that recording session at <i><b><a href=""https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/all-night-recording-sessions.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">The inspiring frisson of an all-night recording session out in the wilds</a></b></i>!

The recorder was a Sony PCM-M10, with one furry windshield &#8212; a R&#248;de DeadKitten (original, more effective, version) &#8212;, and placed on a Hama Mini tripod, which I regard as tiny rather than just mini!

Post-recording processing was to apply EQ in Audacity to correct for the muffling effect of the windshield, and more recent processing with the A1 Stereo Control VST plugin (160% widening).

So I didn't rush on to the sort of places where I might hang wind chimes (looking silly, trying to record them with no wind!), and, on the Hunter's Path just past my closest point to Fingle Bridge (and high up above it), I set up on the very steep slope there to take a recording of the birds, with the rushing sound of the River Teign tumbling over rocks far down below. This recording, then, is the outcome.

The birds were mostly not very close, and hence the recording being quiet. It is just peaceful and refreshing.

Also the inevitable herring gulls at times, with rock pipits, occasional jackdaws. In contrast with the other concurrent recording, the sea here is heard directly, from the other side of Zawn Wells, with some nice minor impacts and splashdowns on the cliffs there, which lead to Pordenack Point. &#8212; A peaceful but also exhilarating sea panorama with 'different' and distinguished atmosphere!</b>

I recorded this — the more southerly of two concurrent recordings — on 26 June 2013, just back from the clifftop overlooking the minor narrow inlet called Zawn Wells, near Land's End, Penwith, Cornwall, UK, on a hike from Cape Cornwall, on the rocky and rugged coast path to Gwennap Head, near Porthgwarra. To quote from my journal:

--------------------------
Again the swell was small and not going to make exciting recordings. The choughs were more vocal at various points from Cot Valley towards Gwynver, but I didn't see obvious places to stop for a recording for those, and was aiming for a lunch-stop recording where I'd made the spectacular clifftop recordings 3 weeks ago overlooking Enys Dodnan etc.

In the event I had a surprise, because as I was coming towards passing by Enys Dodnan I heard extremely rapidly repeated chough calls just ahead, and found that it was 3 young choughs together among the grass &amp; heather. I then backed off a bit and got out a recorder and used it hand-held using a Hama mini-tripod as a grip. After a very few minutes the three joined the parents, which were flying just below the clifftop, and they all went off in the Land's End direction.

I then placed that recorder on a prominent rock and set up the other recorder a bit further along, facing more towards the higher line of cliff leading to Pordenack Point, and then had my lunch stop. The choughs stayed away then, but it was clearly a great soundscape, with a lot of interest from great black-backed gulls on Enys Dodnan, and periodic jackdaws and quite a lot of rock pipit sound. And then, just as I was about to stop the first recording, I heard a distant chough in the Land's End direction, so held off &#8212; and, sure enough, the five of them came back and were flying around. So I extended the session for probably some 15 min before reluctantly packing up and moving on, with the choughs still having a whale of a time there.
--------------------------

<b>Advisory</b>

Because of the processing to widen and sharpen the originally atrocious stereo imaging, the sea may sound rather phasey when listened to from certain speaker systems. Therefore high-grade headphones are by far the best solution.

<b>Techie stuff</b>

The recorder was Sony PCM-M10, with R&#248;de DeadKitten furry windshield (original, more effective, version). It was set up on a Zipshot Mini tripod, which is what I'd regard as 'midi', standing on a little rock surface among the stunted heather growth.

Post-recording processing was to apply EQ in Audacity to correct for the muffling effect of the windshield &#8212; and then more recently stereo widening / sharpening-up using the VST plugin A1 Stereo Control (160% widening).

Kidričevo is one of the younger places, it is an urban, modern settlement that is not devoid of soul. It was created as a newly built industrial settlement, which grew with residential blocks among pine forests in the middle of the Dravsko polje, not far from the alumina and aluminum factory, and assumed a leading role in the wider area and developed into an independent local and municipal center. Kidričevo is a special phenomenon of a modern place, located in the historically rich cultural landscape of the old parish centers of Sveti Lovrenc, Sveta Kungota, Cirkovci and the municipal center of Slovenja vas, and in the triangle Ravno polje manor, Turnišče castle and Ptujska Gora.

Several stonechats were flitting around in a patch of gorse and uttering their unmistakable little 'chat!' sounds like hitting two pebbles together.

The background sea noise is muted because this is rather back from the cliff edge. This recording was actually rather spoiled by the quite modest breeze, despite my use of a Rycote Mini Windjammer on my Sony PCM-M10 (using internal mics). I therefore took the liberty (which I want to avoid generally) of using some EQ in WavePad to tame the wind sound and bring the birds a bit more to the fore.

Please note that the volume level of this recording has been carefully adjusted for listening purposes, and ALL my recordings so far are meant to be listened to with a volume setting that would give a realistic level for playback of CLASSICAL music (a large but not exceptional symphony orchestra). If you have the right volume setting, you should not need to change that setting from one recording of mine to another.

345481,https://freesound.org/people/Philip_Goddard/sounds/345481/,Branscombe Landslip - Birds and sea echoes on cliff - part 2,"['peregrine-falcon', 'England', 'field-recording', 'nature', 'spring', 'English-Channel', 'UK', 'Devon', 'PCM-M10', 'Branscombe-Landslip', 'ambience', 'natural-soundscape', 'sea', 'birds', 'birdsong', 'cliff']","On 24 April 2016 I took out my recently purchased Sony PCM-D100 recorder to Branscombe Landslip, near Beer, Devon, UK, to record there, in the landslip's beautiful reverberant acoustic, for as much of the day as was practical (about 10.15 a.m. to 6.0 p.m.), making concurrent recordings with that recorder and a PCM-M10, to see how they compared. 

The results can reasonably be described as astounding. Over these last few years I'd been under the impression, like many other people, that the PCM-M10's recordings were brilliant - spacious and full of detail, and generally greatly lifelike. But now, having heard the M10 recordings alongside similar albeit not completely identical recordings made with the D100 on this day, I've been feeling quite embarrassed that I'd been putting in public display recordings that I now recognise as actually having a seriously blurred stereo image and a sort of sonic fogginess that obscures a whole mass of detail.

I came to the conclusion that I was very unlikely ever again to record with a PCM-M10. After toying with the idea of using external mics with the M10 in future, I came to the conclusion that I was very unlikely ever again to record with a PCM-M10 at all, as external mics are a lot of additional gear to squeezed into my already very full rucksack on my hiking outings. Instead, in order to have two recorders as I'm used to working with, I actually ordered a second D100.

I should emphasize that I always use the D100 with the 120-degree wide stereo mic configuration. Its 90-degree XY setting produces a very narrow soundstage that has no relevance to recordings of natural soundscapes.

(Later note, February 2021 - last year some experimentation showed that with the D100 I should be able to get excellent wide-soundstage **zoomed-in** recordings with the D100 set at 90° XY, by the simple means of post-recording processing with the VST plugin A1 Stereo Control, in two passes, the first at 200% and the second at 110%. I can't wait to get out to some of my prime recording sites to get some zoomed-in recordings like that - no more so than the hilarious colony of guillemots in a large cave in the south-side cliffs of Pentargon Cove, near Boscastle, Cornwall.)

[<i><b>2024 annotation</b>
— I since found that I'd been considerably overdoing the widening for the M10 recordings. By careful experimentation I found that about 160° widening gave the most faithful and coherent stereo image, and redid the widening for all my M10 recordings previously so over-widened.</i>]

Anyway, I decided I would delete the M10 recordings I made on this day, to save space on my computer, despite their being excellent recordings in terms of what the M10 can do. I thought, however, that some people would appreciate these recordings despite their shortcomings, and so I am sharing them all here before I delete them from my system.

This is the final of the two parts of the third of these M10 recordings made on that day, and was made from a tripod right beside the coast path in an openly wooded part of the landslip, just round the corner from where a steep and precarious narrow track leading towards a cave high up on the chalk cliff towering above comes out on the main path. The recorder is facing approximately north, facing the chalk cliff towering above, in an attempt to maximally capture the echo of each wave as it spread along the cliff from left to right - but as usual it has made a complete hash of that.

The 'direct' (actually shielded) sea sound was actually hard left, not just left-of-centre, and the echo of each wave could be clearly heard moving from left to right on the cliff, instead of just the vague haze of sound from the cliff that the M10 'hears'.  By contrast, the D100 captured the echoes faithfully, to such an extent that I really felt I could hear the shape of the cliff face towering above!

As usual the windshield was the Rode DeadKitten (old light-grey version, which performs better than the current black version). I used Audacity to apply a custom EQ profile to correct for the high frequency muffling caused by the windshield and also to correct for the audible broad 'hump' in the bass frequencies of ALL my PCM-M10 recordings prior to processing.

Various birds are singing and often answering others of same species in different parts of the landslip and undercliff. The striking and perhaps rather scary-sounding repeated squealing wails are from a peregrine falcon, one or a pair of which periodically did little flyabouts, no doubt as a courtship thing at this time of year. Often such calls were preceded by the sound of an agitated and no doubt frightened raven being chased by the peregrine that was subsequently to utter its wailing calls.

Another distinctive sound from the peregrine(s) was a sort of chattering - a fast succession of 'clicks' with an intense rather squealed quality about them; this was actually a very loud sound compared with the various alarm calls made by the songbirds, for it was generally made from high cliff perch or nesting positions and yet still stood out from all the nearby songbirds' alarm calls.

Please note that the volume level of this recording has been carefully adjusted for listening purposes, and, except where otherwise expressly indicated, ALL my recordings so far are meant to be listened to with a volume setting that would give a realistic level for playback of CLASSICAL music (a large but not exceptional symphony orchestra). If you have the right volume setting, you should not need to change that setting from one recording of mine to another.

Bill also released AMAZONAS, an electroacoustic folk LP, which can be downloaded for free with an optional donation to the Rainforest Trust: <a href=""https://safesounds.ca/amazonas"" rel=""nofollow"">https://safesounds.ca/amazonas</a>",https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,33.1103,"{'preview-hq-mp3': 'https://cdn.freesound.org/previews/669/669354_53551-hq.mp3', 'preview-hq-ogg': 'https://cdn.freesound.org/previews/669/669354_53551-hq.ogg', 'preview-lq-mp3': 'https://cdn.freesound.org/previews/669/669354_53551-lq.mp3', 'preview-lq-ogg': 'https://cdn.freesound.org/previews/669/669354_53551-lq.ogg'}"

However, neither of them are quite dead: they lie asleep in the inaccessible caverns called the King’s Chamber and the Queen’s Chamber.

Fields spread around the village. The drainage channel of the Zlatoličje HPP is laid under the village. The population is mixed, workers and farmers.
The stream Hajdinska Studenčnica once originated below the settlement, which dried up after the construction of the Drava canal for the hydroelectric plant. The village lies at an altitude of 235m and is quite spread out.
Special features are the water tower next to the main road, the industrial zone on the outskirts of the village, adjacent to Zlatoličje, and the drainage canal of the hydroelectric plant. Kartodrom Slovenja vas, opened in 2018, is located near Ptuj. In the center stands the Church of the Assumption, built in 1992.
