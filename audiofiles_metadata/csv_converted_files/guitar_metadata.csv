I am in a highly experimental mode, guess it's evident from the work.

Of late, my ideas about creativity and music are undergoing big changes. This can be seen as an attempt to document my current mindset. In fact, it's the part of the search itself.

This song has many 'spots' that could give you a perfect musical experience. I may have left them understated or unpolished. I invite you all to use your imagination to fill the imperfections and enjoy the music.

From 100 BPM to 200 BPM.

Each of those 21 versions have a ""clean"" version which has no additional effects (save for compression).

From there I then created different combinations of effects and then saved each track.
