The gentle pitter-patter of rain falling on the greenhouse creates a soothing symphony that envelops the senses in a cocoon of tranquility. As each droplet makes contact with the glass roof, it produces a soft, rhythmic melody that resonates throughout the enclosed space. The sound is calming and meditative, invoking a sense of peace and serenity within those who are fortunate enough to experience it. The steady cadence of the rain provides a comforting backdrop for reflection and contemplation, allowing one to escape from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. With each passing minute, the sound becomes more hypnotic, lulling listeners into a state of deep relaxation as they surrender themselves to its hypnotic embrace.

The rain sound itself is subdued from this viewpoint, and accompanied by much trickling sound from run-off water in drainpipes — a very pleasantly watery soundscape.</b>

When I got up on Saturday 28 September 2013 with daylight hardly showing yet, I was aware of some quite heavy rain, but not at all expecting thunder. With the double-glazed windows closed I thought I was also hearing the refuse collectors banging around a bit as I went to get breakfast. Then I saw a flash and got my brain into gear &#8212; not refuse collectors at all: wrong day! Hurried set-up of recorder on bedroom window sill!

Thank goodness, although it was early morning there was surprisingly little pronounced traffic noise as I'd expect normally at that time (this is in city centre) &#8212; no doubt because it was a Saturday, and maybe the rain was discouraging some people from setting out so early. So I had surprisingly little to cut out of the recording because of disturbances.

Location of recording: Exeter city centre, Devon, UK.

<b>Advisory</b>

Despite this being a peaceful soundscape the dynamic range is still pretty large. For a realistic rendition a volume setting of <b>9dB higher</b> than a sensible normal level is necessary. Also, high-grade headphones would generally get the best listening results.

<img alt=""Setup for this recording (Ouch!)&#8230;"" src=""https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/130928_bedroom-windowsill-old-recording-setup.jpg"">
<i>As no sufficiently relevant photo was available, I just took this afternoon shot on 12 July 2023 to show my hilariously precarious setup for all my bedroom window recordings up to my disastrous one on the night of 26-27 May 2017, about more of which just see below&#8230;
&#8212; Dash! Just noticed. I thought the recorder should be a little more forward, and I now see why. The tripod should be the other way round, with one leg at the rear and the other two at the front!</i>

<b>Techie stuff:</b>

The recorder was a Sony PCM-M10, with R&#248;de DeadKitten furry windshield (original, superior, light-grey version). It was ill-advisedly (read 'stupidly'!)* placed on a Hama Mini tripod, which is very mini, on my bedroom window sill, raised sufficiently by a stack of books, and with the thick curtain pulled across behind it to minimize sounds from within my flat (and doors also kept closed).

*I say 'ill-advisedly' because in certain circumstances the recorder could easily get pushed or knocked out of the (second-floor) window, with paving stones to fall on below. This did happen with my first PCM D100 in 2017, which taught me not to take chances about that in the future. &#8212; And then I remembered a much chunkier Velbon 'mini' tripod that was languishing in a drawer, and used that with no leg extension and maximum column extension, which took the recorder to just the right height with the legs still fitting on the ledge, the recorder a little further forward, and not a book in sight. That setup was impossible to get pushed out of the window, so since then it's been my standard arrangement for bedroom window recordings.

As to the fate of that D100 recorder that did hit the paving stone &#8212; that model is, figuratively, built like a tank, and although the (metal) casing was a bit buckled, and it was a little fiddly operating control buttons because the casing was raised a little on top, with some edge gaps, to this day it still works flawlessly. I just regard it as a backup 'extra', and also always use it for bedroom window recordings &#8212; of course with small polythene bag around its body to minimize ingress of dust, water and prying little beasties. So, yes, you could say I have a fond 'special relationship' with that recorder, which is my elite bedroom-window thunderstorm one.

Post-recording processing was EQ in Audacity to correct for muffling caused by the furry windshield, and to correct for a quite strong 'alcove resonance' in the low bass, which any recorder picks up there. Subsequent processing was in A1 Stereo Control VST plugin to widen and sharpen the stereo image (160%).

Previous I used an upside down broken cloths basket lined at the top with a plastic garbage can liner to catch the sound of snow falling a few weeks ago. Strangely enough spring like weather hit us in Michigan during the middle of our snow season, so we've had a lot of rain lately. I figured I'd try the same set-up I used for recording snow, but for rain instead. It was also trash day in our subdivision so you might hear some distant garbage trucks and the usual traffic hum of the Motor City ( The nick name for Detroit, MI). The rain hitting the plastic liner about 3 inches above the mic, sort of sounds like a crackling from a fire to me, which I thought was kind of cool.

For those who are already experienced in mindfulness and feel they do not need guided meditations anymore, here is a 20 minute rain sound with just a few bells. At the beginning and the end, there are 3 consecutive hits. Around 6' and 13' I have also put single hits that help to re-focus if your mind has started to wander.

The rain sound has two advantages: first it is nice :-) then it acts like a white noise and isolates from noisy environments.

159678,https://freesound.org/people/Philip_Goddard/sounds/159678/,Gentle night rain with a hint of seagulls and thunder,"['small-hours', 'field-recording', 'thunder', 'peaceful', 'distant-thunder', 'rain', 'quiet', 'weather', 'trickling', 'night']","In the small hours of 28th June 2012 it was raining a bit here in central Exeter, UK (which very rarely has thunderstorms), and I heard an occasional very distant boom of thunder. Just in case the storm was going to develop more and come over, I set up my Sony PCM-M10 raised up on a window ledge in my bedroom and set it going at 02.50, getting back into bed and leaving it to to capture whatever it would.

I'd set the recording level very low in order not to have any close lightning strikes clipped, but I needn't have worried about that because all I got was a recording of the gentle rain (only just audible) plus the more noticeable trickling of rainwater off my roof, with the occasional sound of seagulls and an almost constant deep muttering and mumbling of thunder at or just beyond the limit of audibility (you need speakers / headphones with extended low bass response to hear much of it), and with the very occasional more distinctly audible but still very quiet booms of thunder. Because of the low recording level, my normalizing the file to a genuinely representative level has meant a very considerable amplification, and I was thus really surprised how well it came out. 

As the thunder was receding and the rain / trickling sounds gradually reducing while the recorder was running, after some half-hour I terminated the recording (enviously seeing extremely frequent lightning flashing far away to the south-east, meaning the storm was entertaining people somewhere else and not coming my way at all), and subsequently I cut off the last bit of the recording to improve the overall effect.

Actually that storm system remained virulently active through the day, causing widespread havoc especially in the Midlands and northern England, with flash floods, local large hail and the odd tornado. What I had missed! :-(

So, this recording is a non-event as a thunderstorm recording but is still a nice bit of quiet 'atmosphere'. The seagulls are mostly Herring Gull, but with some Lesser Black-backed Gull. The latter have a similar range of sounds to the Herring Gull, but with distinctively reedy or hoarse-sounding voice.

Please note that the volume level of this recording has been carefully adjusted for listening purposes, and ALL my recordings so far are meant to be listened to with a volume setting that would give a realistic level for playback of CLASSICAL music (a large but not exceptional symphony orchestra). If you have the right volume setting, you should not need to change that setting from one recording of mine to another.

It does have the plastic rain impact sound because of my garden furniture which I think would be easy to EQ out if you have a low pass.
Do check the sounds for potential unwanted noise. Since this was a longer uninterrupted recording it may have captured my dorm mates going up the stairs, eventual cars. It was recorded at 3:00am so the unwanted noises are minimal.

""This sound fiction begins with the sound of water and soft wind as a recreation of the Amazonian landscape. Gradually sounds of birds, monkeys and insects are added to the ficcion. Suddenly this environment is interrupted by the sound of footsteps, human voices and trees cutters. After the crash of a fallen tree there is a decrease in the environment sounds. 

Then rain starts and you can hear the sound of frogs and some distant thunder. A human voice sings a ritual chant: another Amazon tree has been destroyed.

The sounds of water, wind, light rain and machines have been drawn from different patches made with Pure date. The sounds of frogs, birds, monkeys and insects are from Freesound. We have done the steps with Foley and the song has been recorded live

I left the dummy-head to record in the conservatory, in the early hours of 28/10/2013, while I slept, expecting a storm. I only got some lovely drain sounds, and some rain, blustery wind and a few window rattles..

Recorded in a long lean-to conservatory. 40mm Multiwall polycarbonate roof, single glazed windows to front, Mic left end facing front.
 
Elaborate drain-pipe system on left side going down to diverter in greenhouse, front, then along gulley just outside-left and then in to floor-level drain  (back,left). 'Plops' left/back/down. 'Trickling' from gutter and drainpipes to the front and left. Rain on roof diffuse, mainly up and right.

Loses quite a lot of detail using the built-in player's MP3 lossy compression.
Best downloaded, and played using headphones.

Great reference recording to test headphones for their binaural imaging capabilities, to see if they do up/down, front/back, and distance resolution, as well as the usual right/left/spaciousness thingies. I would love to learn, through ""Comments"", which headphones work well and which do not.. Works on Sennheiser HD 219. As always, the downloaded version and some 'adjustment' time is needed, to get the full effect. More subtle than a virtual haircut...

This is file for creating deep ambiance. 

Just mix that sound with other ambiance sound (on free sound there is at least a million such sounds...like noice..like thunder rain ...like station...like people tallk and so far...). It works best with noises or other deep sounds.

I think if you add a little bit of that sound to other audio file you can get very spezial sound for ambiante.

In this imaginary place, rain falls down once in a year and never last for more than a few seconds. This is actually a good thing, considering the fact that rain is a highly corrosive substance.  Even though people are able to predict rainy days, local weather services do make mistakes.
This is the only known record of « acid rain ». The recording machine luckily survived.

In the real world, I simply recorded the sound of fingers tapping a glass and duplicated the sound over and over. No effects added, except a fading out.

I decided to compare two recording methods:  my spaced pair em273 omnis with bike helmet as a baffle in between, and the h1n internal XY cardioid mics. 

This recording is with the XY mics - it is a lot more 'close-up', with a big stereo spread in the near field. It picks up much less bass from the distant road noise, and has less of a stereo image for the medium distance forest noises. It feels a bit more 'intimate' than the omni recording, but loses a broader sense of location. It tends to bring near sounds into sharp focus.

You can hear a lot of thunder strikes from all directions, some rain noise in the background, sometimes a car passing by on a wet road somewhere beneath. Also after the closest strikes, some car alarms are becoming audible too.

One strike peaked at 0dB with minimum gain used. I got clip indicator lit on one channel.

Some thunders are so close and clean, they sound like a giant electrig gas igniter.

I've never had so many this good thunder shots recorded. This file is a gold mine for all your thunderstorm sound needs.

I'm uploading raw recording. Not edited and not normalized. It's only converted to FLAC for saving on file size. The quality's there :)

The recording starts in a middle of the thunderstorm, whitch is slowly starting to fade away.

I recorded this from a high flat's balcony using a hand-held Zoom H2's rear stereo XY mics (120 deg. of spread). Using no dynamics processor of filter, with mic gain set to low (minimum).

Originally it was a stereo 48-kHz, 24-bit WAV file. Examined and converted to 24-bit FLAC using Audacity.

I hope you'll enjoy this recording as much as I did making it.",http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/,2475.5,"{'preview-hq-mp3': 'https://cdn.freesound.org/previews/159/159321_1038806-hq.mp3', 'preview-hq-ogg': 'https://cdn.freesound.org/previews/159/159321_1038806-hq.ogg', 'preview-lq-mp3': 'https://cdn.freesound.org/previews/159/159321_1038806-lq.mp3', 'preview-lq-ogg': 'https://cdn.freesound.org/previews/159/159321_1038806-lq.ogg'}"
