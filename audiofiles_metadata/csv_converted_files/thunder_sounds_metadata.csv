The rain sound itself is subdued from this viewpoint, and accompanied by much trickling sound from run-off water in drainpipes — a very pleasantly watery soundscape.</b>

When I got up on Saturday 28 September 2013 with daylight hardly showing yet, I was aware of some quite heavy rain, but not at all expecting thunder. With the double-glazed windows closed I thought I was also hearing the refuse collectors banging around a bit as I went to get breakfast. Then I saw a flash and got my brain into gear &#8212; not refuse collectors at all: wrong day! Hurried set-up of recorder on bedroom window sill!

Thank goodness, although it was early morning there was surprisingly little pronounced traffic noise as I'd expect normally at that time (this is in city centre) &#8212; no doubt because it was a Saturday, and maybe the rain was discouraging some people from setting out so early. So I had surprisingly little to cut out of the recording because of disturbances.

Location of recording: Exeter city centre, Devon, UK.

<b>Advisory</b>

Despite this being a peaceful soundscape the dynamic range is still pretty large. For a realistic rendition a volume setting of <b>9dB higher</b> than a sensible normal level is necessary. Also, high-grade headphones would generally get the best listening results.

<img alt=""Setup for this recording (Ouch!)&#8230;"" src=""https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/130928_bedroom-windowsill-old-recording-setup.jpg"">
<i>As no sufficiently relevant photo was available, I just took this afternoon shot on 12 July 2023 to show my hilariously precarious setup for all my bedroom window recordings up to my disastrous one on the night of 26-27 May 2017, about more of which just see below&#8230;
&#8212; Dash! Just noticed. I thought the recorder should be a little more forward, and I now see why. The tripod should be the other way round, with one leg at the rear and the other two at the front!</i>

<b>Techie stuff:</b>

The recorder was a Sony PCM-M10, with R&#248;de DeadKitten furry windshield (original, superior, light-grey version). It was ill-advisedly (read 'stupidly'!)* placed on a Hama Mini tripod, which is very mini, on my bedroom window sill, raised sufficiently by a stack of books, and with the thick curtain pulled across behind it to minimize sounds from within my flat (and doors also kept closed).

*I say 'ill-advisedly' because in certain circumstances the recorder could easily get pushed or knocked out of the (second-floor) window, with paving stones to fall on below. This did happen with my first PCM D100 in 2017, which taught me not to take chances about that in the future. &#8212; And then I remembered a much chunkier Velbon 'mini' tripod that was languishing in a drawer, and used that with no leg extension and maximum column extension, which took the recorder to just the right height with the legs still fitting on the ledge, the recorder a little further forward, and not a book in sight. That setup was impossible to get pushed out of the window, so since then it's been my standard arrangement for bedroom window recordings.

As to the fate of that D100 recorder that did hit the paving stone &#8212; that model is, figuratively, built like a tank, and although the (metal) casing was a bit buckled, and it was a little fiddly operating control buttons because the casing was raised a little on top, with some edge gaps, to this day it still works flawlessly. I just regard it as a backup 'extra', and also always use it for bedroom window recordings &#8212; of course with small polythene bag around its body to minimize ingress of dust, water and prying little beasties. So, yes, you could say I have a fond 'special relationship' with that recorder, which is my elite bedroom-window thunderstorm one.

Post-recording processing was EQ in Audacity to correct for muffling caused by the furry windshield, and to correct for a quite strong 'alcove resonance' in the low bass, which any recorder picks up there. Subsequent processing was in A1 Stereo Control VST plugin to widen and sharpen the stereo image (160%).

A baby woke up from it. The ice cream man, always playing the same tune on his truck, tries to sell some ice creams quickly, but then it starts to rain and the wind blows. The customers go home quickly.
After a while every now and then a large raindrop falls on the microphones and that gives a nice ticking sound. Now listening back it gives the experience that I am in the rain myself. Eventually I move the equipment carefully so as not to disturb the sound recording too much.
Slowly but surely the storm moves further north. It becomes quiet.

Sometimes a car passing, a dog baking and sometime a human voice. Most of the time just the rain in he gutter on plants, trees, on the street and on he cars and the far and sometimes close thunder. There is a great variation in rain, wind and thunder sound-level.

My metaphor on this recording is getting older, disability, death represented by thunder, wind and rain and the daily life that continues far away in the background represented by the other sounds in the background. 
Life is meaningless , so enjoy it!

Useful as background in film, movie, game and radio-play etc. Pick out your part!

I really wanted to capture the terrific crack of the thunder as well as the effect of thunder rolling around the hills. 

As I didn't have a better mic on hand, I made a new recording using the back-up function of my portable recorder. This function will make two recordings simultaneously, one 10dB lower than the other. I used the softer recording as the base, and then layered on the louder recording twice. The first time I used a filter to remove any frequencies below 4570 Hz. This gave me the crack of the thunder and the sense of air and movement. The second layer removed frequencies below 300 Hz, which meant that you can hear the rain. The result is much closer to the sounds that I could hear.

HIFI RECORDING. 
<img alt="""" src=""http://static.panoramio.com/photos/medium/100487873.jpg"" />
It starts with the first far thunder. Than a more wind and dripping in the trees and long time of no thunders and no rain. Right the highway behind the apartment building. Left local traffic over the wet suburban road. 

After 17 minutes the most beautiful part of this recording. A door slam shut. Loose parts start to make noise. The wind howling trough the sun-blinds. Large drips fall on the aluminium railing and wooden tiles. An aluminium chair runs over the balcony. It seem that the thunderstorm comes closer, but just the far high altitude rolling thunder audible through the strong winds and rain. The last rumble and drips. I can see the stars. An other illusion is born again, but he result is better then I thought. 

I hope you enjoy.

Just in case the storm was going to develop more and come over, I set up my Sony PCM-M10 raised up on a window ledge in my bedroom and set it going at 02.50, getting back into bed and leaving it to to capture whatever it would.

I'd set the recording level very low in order not to have any close lightning strikes clipped, but I needn't have worried about that because all I got was a recording of the gentle rain (only just audible) plus the more noticeable trickling of rainwater off my roof, with the occasional sound of seagulls and an almost constant deep muttering and mumbling of thunder at or just beyond the limit of audibility (you need speakers / headphones with extended low bass response to hear much of it), and with the very occasional more distinctly audible but still very quiet booms of thunder. Because of the low recording level, my normalizing the file to a genuinely representative level has meant a very considerable amplification, and I was thus really surprised how well it came out. 

As the thunder was receding and the rain / trickling sounds gradually reducing while the recorder was running, after some half-hour I terminated the recording (enviously seeing extremely frequent lightning flashing far away to the south-east, meaning the storm was entertaining people somewhere else and not coming my way at all), and subsequently I cut off the last bit of the recording to improve the overall effect.

Actually that storm system remained virulently active through the day, causing widespread havoc especially in the Midlands and northern England, with flash floods, local large hail and the odd tornado. What I had missed! :-(

So, this recording is a non-event as a thunderstorm recording but is still a nice bit of quiet 'atmosphere'. The seagulls are mostly Herring Gull, but with some Lesser Black-backed Gull. The latter have a similar range of sounds to the Herring Gull, but with distinctively reedy or hoarse-sounding voice.

Please note that the volume level of this recording has been carefully adjusted for listening purposes, and ALL my recordings so far are meant to be listened to with a volume setting that would give a realistic level for playback of CLASSICAL music (a large but not exceptional symphony orchestra). If you have the right volume setting, you should not need to change that setting from one recording of mine to another.

It does have the plastic rain impact sound because of my garden furniture which I think would be easy to EQ out if you have a low pass.
Do check the sounds for potential unwanted noise. Since this was a longer uninterrupted recording it may have captured my dorm mates going up the stairs, eventual cars. It was recorded at 3:00am so the unwanted noises are minimal.

Improved version of one of my first uploads here.</b>

In the small hours of 28th June 2012 it was raining a bit here in central Exeter, UK (which very rarely has thunderstorms), and I heard an occasional very distant boom of thunder. Just in case the storm was going to develop more and come over, I set up my Sony PCM-M10 raised up on a window ledge in my bedroom and set it going at 02.50, getting back into bed and leaving it to to capture whatever it would.

I'd set the recording level very low in order not to have any close lightning strikes clipped, but I needn't have worried about that because all I got was a recording of the gentle rain (only just audible) plus the more noticeable trickling of rainwater off my roof, with the occasional sound of seagulls and an almost constant deep muttering and mumbling of thunder at or just beyond the limit of audibility (you need speakers / headphones with extended low bass response to hear much of it), and with the very occasional more distinctly audible but still very quiet booms of thunder. Because of the low recording level, my normalizing the file to a genuinely representative level has meant a very considerable amplification, and I was thus really surprised how well it came out. 

As the thunder was receding and the rain / trickling sounds gradually reducing while the recorder was running, after some half-hour I terminated the recording (enviously seeing the sky lit up far away to the south-east by almost continuous lightning, meaning the storm was entertaining people somewhere else and not coming my way at all), and subsequently I cut off the last bit of the recording to improve the overall effect.

Actually that storm system remained virulently active through the day, causing widespread havoc especially in the Midlands and northern England, with flash floods, local large hail and the odd tornado. What I'd missed! :-(

So, this recording is a non-event as a thunderstorm recording but is still a nice bit of quiet 'atmosphere'. The seagulls are mostly Herring Gull, but with some Lesser Black-backed Gull. The latter have a similar range of sounds to the Herring Gull, but with distinctively reedy or hoarse-sounding voice.


<b>Techie stuff:</b>

The recorder was Sony PCM-M10, with Rycote Mini Windjammer furry windshield. It was set up on a Hama Mini tripod, which I regard as not just 'mini' but tiny, and so had to be raised up on a pile of books to be at the right height (NOT a good arrangement, as I learnt the hard way later on!).

Post-recording processing was to apply EQ in Audacity to correct for the muffling effect of the windshield &#8212; and to correct for a lower bass resonance caused by the shallow window alcove, and then more recently stereo widening / sharpening-up using the VST plugin A1 Stereo Control (160% widening).

This sound file captures the ambient noises of a rainy night in the city. The steady patter of rain creates a soothing and consistent background, while occasional rolls of thunder add a dramatic element. The sound of cars driving on the wet road is also prominent, with the splashing of tires through puddles and the distant hum of engines. The combination of natural and urban sounds creates a rich and immersive audio experience.

Recorded on a TASCAM DR-40. Cleaned up in audio (removed occasional other sounds from my neighborhood).

Theres a little handling noise click in the begining that is easy to crop out if you like. The recording is unedited.

At 1:35 I move the mics closer to the deck so you can hear the splashing. At about At 3:10 I you’ll hear a different timbre as I move away from the rain and under an awning. About 3:45 the rain settles down and the birds start chirping again. Hopefully there are some useful segments in here.

This one is a surprisingly big crack and rumble preceded and followed by a nice sounding rain.  I made this by positioning a stereo-matched pair of AKG C451B condenser mics in an exaggerated X-Y configuration (a wider stereo field) and aiming them out of my open window.  The mics went into a Universal Audio 2-610 preamp, an Apogee Duet 2, and then Ableton at 48kHz and 24 bits.  I believe I had the mics set flat, and there was no post processing (though I was mightily tempted to upload the much-better-sounding EQed and compressed files) so that you can fine tune it to suit your needs.  You'll notice that the loudest parts of the thunder boom clipped the input, but, due to the pleasant and forgiving nature of vacuum tubes, the clipping sounds more compressed than distorted.

There's a higher pitched harsh pinging roar from outside the building, the soft rush of rain on the tree overhanging the hole in the roof, and the slower, random dripping sound of raindrops hitting the pooled water on the concrete floor. The rainfall noise from inside the building echos and reverberates within the building, while the outside rain (and thunder) doesn't echo. 

Recorded on August 13, 2021, during an afternoon sudden rainstorm in Taipei, Taiwan, Xinyi District. The location is in a dense neighborhood of 5 story multi family units, many of which have tin sidings and awnings. Two small units are bombed-out looking collapsed concrete structures, with the kitchens still intact, which towards the end of the recording can be heard emitting the sound of drips hitting their porcelain sinks. Overhanging the building's collapsed roof (partially concrete and wood) is an old growth tree. It's a very beautiful location and I'm very pleased with the soundscape it offers during a rainstorm.

i used a program called Audacity to edit multiple recordings together to achieve the right effect (in this cause a wall crumbling to the ground) i used a thunder recording as well as rocks hitting the ground some explosion sound and a gravely sound.

The passing thunder tapers off into a rainstorm for most of the track and you'll hear the dawn bird chorus. About 17 minutes in you start hearing a strange angelic type music (at least that's what it sounds like in my headphones), still not sure what this sound is, my best guess is that it's produced reverberating sound of semis on US-131 coming through the forest.

It is sudden and loud with many reverberant rumbles occurring afterwards. There is some rain noise on a tin roof throughout the recording.

This sound has a few problems. It was just too cool of a sound to throw away, so I fixed it up as best I could.
Someone near me screamed during the first second of the thunder. I tried to reduce the scream as much as possible without decreasing the sound quality, but it can still be heard if you listen closely.
There was also a bit of clipping, but I fixed that with Audacity's repair tool.

The goal was to create a nice stereo effect. 

<b>Gear chain</b> 
* Rode NT4 XY in Rode Blimp > Sound Devices 302 >Tascam dr-100 Mk2. 
* And Primo EM 172 In Rode Blimp >  Sony PCM D50 recorder

In (my) theory it is/was not possible to get a nice result because;
1 the great distance (10m) between the mics
2 the building as barrier between the two signals (I want to use this)
3 the out-of-sinc problem of the two different recorders 


<b>Steps in Audacity to create the result</b>
Step 1 - Change Left/Right of the EM172's
Step 2 - Synchronisation of the two signals.
Step 3 - Rode NT4 (XY90) signals split to double mono
Step 4 - Invert one channel of EM172's to create a special MS setting (to create accent on left and right channel.
Step 5 - Than these signals tune and combine. 

This (NEW?) recording technique I call the KMS setting. K stands for Klankbeeld, hahaha an MS for normal MS setting.

He man, It worked..... I could not believe my ears...

All the thunder is rather to very distant, apart from one very loud and moderately startling (presumably) ground strike (probably two or three in rapid succession).</b>

<b>Thunderstorms are quite a rarity in Exeter, so for me each storm is a very special event.</b>

This thundery shower developed and largely just passed by during early afternoon, 11 June 2020, and I was doubtful how worthwhile it would be recording at this time, with all the city noise. The small hours is the time to get decent thunderstorm recordings from my abode. However, frustrated with all the covid restrictions, I set the recorder up anyway as soon as I saw suspicious-looking cloud developments, just in case. In the event there was a <i>lot</i> of disturbance, including yacking neighbours, but at least the rain chased them off somewhat.

Usually my edits are carefully done and are undetectable, but there's one significant edit that does attract attention to itself this time. That is just after the rain has started, just at moderate intensity to start with. The observant listener would notice that when the rain rapidly becomes quite heavy, the trickling and gurgling of run-off from all the neighbourhood's roofs increases simultaneously. To avoid that giveaway, I'd have had to cut out a whole lot more, so I just had to keep it like that. Also, I'm not altogether keen on my immediate neighbour's budgies getting in on the act so prominently, but if I were going to cut <i>them</i> out I'd have little recording left!

<b>Advisory:</b>
To hear this to best effect you need high-grade headphones, and to have the volume setting about <b>9dB above</b> a sensible normal level for a realistic rendition of symphonic orchestral music. That's a trebling of the sound level.

<b>Techie stuff:</b>
The recorder was a Sony PCM-D100, with two nested Windcut furry windshields (custom design), and it was placed on a Velbon Mini tripod with full extension of centre column on my bedroom window sill, with the window as wide open as it would go.

Initial post-recording processing was to apply an EQ curve to compensate for muffling from the furry windshields, and to compensate for 'alcove resonance' in the bass. I used Audacity ('clip fix' function) to repair the clipped peaks of the one loud bit, but in this case the repair didn't work properly, and various peaks in that little angry outburst remain in a clipped state.

686816,https://freesound.org/people/Philip_Goddard/sounds/686816/,Thunderstorm with some ground strikes coming over — BIG dynamic range!,"['weather', 'natural-soundscape', 'lightning-strike', 'storm', 'ambient', 'lightning', 'ambience', 'rumble', 'city', 'rain', 'field-recording', 'city-centre', 'atmosphere', 'Exeter', 'ambiance', 'Devon', 'UK', 'thunderstorm', 'May', 'nature', 'high-dynamic-range', 'thunder']","<b>Warning &#8212; big dynamic range!</b>

<b>A gradual approach of this May thunderstorm in Exeter, UK city centre, culminating in an apocalyptic-sounding ground strike, and then&#8230; nothing much! The rainfall that came over sounded only moderately heavy, though with a scattering of hailstones for a short while.</b>

For a few days the UK Met Office had been showing a quite good thunderstorm likelihood for Exeter from mid-morning to mid-afternoon on 9 May 2023, but then on the day the indications changed to just some mostly light showers &#8212; the thunderstorms now being expected elsewhere. So I didn't bother after all to set up my recorder on my bedroom window ledge &#8212; until, by late morning the thickening clouds were now beginning to look dark and thundery, and I was wondering… I set up the recorder just in case, but then realized that the breeze was enough to blow rain in over the recorder (as indeed forecast), and in the right direction to do so. So I took it down and closed the window, and got on with some work.

Then I heard the odd semi-distant rumble of thunder from a system that was passing-by rather than coming over. I returned the recorder to the bedroom window sill just in case, but that system was already moving away, and the recorder captured nothing worthwhile. But the Rain Alarm app on my phone showed another chunk of heavy to torrential shower coming up close behind, and Lightning Tracker, also on my phone, showed some strikes in that area. It looked as though the wind had dropped, too, so I left the recorder running, and captured about 56' of that particular storm.

Most of it wasn't overhead. It came in from WSW, and as so often happens when a storm does occur here, one arm of it was passing by to the SE, and the other arm passing by on the NE side, with mostly less intense precipitation and darkness here than on either side. A good proportion of the lightnings, even when distant, could be recognised as at least containing ground strikes, because of their sudden heavily explosive sounds. And as usually happens when a thunderstorm does get as close as it's going to, the lightning frequency dropped. Thus when it had got loud to a certain point there were only few further flashes, with big gaps.

After the first of those big gaps we get the two strongest strikes of all &#8212; the second of those being truly apocalyptic in sound if listened to at the indicated volume setting (see further below). There was a further strike with a rather similar sound to that biggest one, but it was one of the many casualties of city noises, and I had to cut it out. &#8212; And after that, just rain, and with a lot of city noise, so I cut all that out too. The original 56' of the recording got reduced to 29' in the process.

<b>Advisory</b> 

Because of the big dynamic range, in order to hear most of the sound even at all, <strong>you need to listen at a volume setting of some 24 (yes, twenty-four) dB above</strong> a normal sensible setting. <strong>High-grade headphones strongly recommended!</strong>

The recorder was a Sony PCM-D100, with two nested Windcut custom furry windshields, and set up on a Velbon Mini tripod.

Post-recording processing was to apply EQ in Audacity to correct for the muffling effect of the windshields, plus correction for a low bass resonance in the particular window recess.

<b>Thunderstorms are quite a rarity in Exeter, so for me each storm is a very special event.</b>

I made this recording through the night of 18&#8211;19 October 2022.

The events are presented in original order, with uneventful interludes each reduced to a useful short length, and all the more intrusive city sounds cut out, though with some flexibility in order to retain as much as possible of the soundscape that I did want. Relatively gentle gusts of wind become apparent during interludes, blowing through the trees as they chase around among the houses.

The sequence is as follows:

<b>1. Very heavy shower.</b>

<b>2. Brief torrential shower.</b>

<b>3. Relatively short (fast-moving) thunderstorm, still more torrential, from first grumbling murmur that I could pick out. None of the lightning was overhead; the centre of the line of storm (moving S. to N., along its axis) passing-by a bit west of here. Presumably for that reason, the thunder gives us no big dramatics; the latter may well still have been happening, but a bit further west.</b>

<b>4. Two brief torrential showers, apparently with a scattering of hailstones</b>

<b>5. Thundery shower, not so torrential.</b>

That final thundery shower has more background traffic noise, as by then it's late in the small hours, and some bleary-eyed motorists are already going to work.

For those wanting the thunderstorm in a smaller download, my next upload here is just that &#8212; though I myself find that particular storm most effective when heard in context, as part of the whole sequence.

<b>Advisory:</b>
To hear this to best effect you need high-grade headphones, and to have the volume setting about <strong>6dB above</strong> a sensible normal level for a realistic rendition of symphonic orchestral music. That's a doubling of the sound level.

Initial post-recording processing was to apply an EQ curve to compensate for muffling from the furry windshields, and to compensate for 'alcove resonance' in the bass.

Noticeable rain doesn't come on till the relatively close lightnings have passed.</b>

<b>Thunderstorms are quite a rarity in Exeter, so for me each such storm is a very special event.</b>

This recording was made on very early morning of 19 September 2014, from my bedroom window in city centre, Exeter, Devon, UK.

For some reason I'd neglected to set up the recorder at bedtime as I normally would when thunderstorms in the area were at all likely, so, about 4.45 a.m. I awoke to the sound of what I took at first to be a very distant high-altitude jet aeroplane, and then suddenly realized what it was, and duly expleted, amusedly cross with myself for not having the recorder already running, then hurriedly set it up. My saving grace this time was the very long approach time of this storm, so if I hadn't said anything about the matter it would seem that I'd captured the storm pretty well from its very first audible murmurs.

<b>Advisory:</b>
To hear this to best effect you need high-grade headphones, and to have the volume setting about <b>9dB above</b> a sensible normal level for a realistic rendition of symphonic orchestral music. To clarify, you need the volume set so that, in the opening, the background sound, with almost inaudible thunder murmurs, is clearly, but only just, audible &#8212; hoping that makes sense!

<i>Thundery sky at sunrise time, on 10 October 2013, as part of the view from my bedroom window, from where I made this recording</i>

<b>Techie stuff:</b>
The recorder was a Sony PCM-M10, with R&#248;de DeadKitten furry windshield (original, more effective version), and it was placed on a Hama Mini tripod (very small) raised up on some books <em>(BAD idea, as I was later to find out the hard way!!)</em> on my bedroom window sill, with the window as wide open as it would go.

Initial post-recording processing was to apply an EQ curve to compensate for muffling from the furry windshield, and to compensate for 'alcove resonance' in the bass, and much more recently it's had stereo widening / sharpening processing to 200% width with <i><b>A1 Stereo Control</b></i> VST plugin, then a 7dB EQ tilt away from the treble (straight line from no change at 100Hz to -7dB at 8K) to compensate for the treble overemphasis caused by the stereo widening.

The file length has been trimmed to a manageable 11:29.8 from its original length of 23:09.8 eliminating some distracting street noises near the end of the original file.

Real rain is a stereo phenomenon, hence the original mono file was converted to stereo using a Haas effect VST plugin developed by mda-vst.  The resulting sound was thereafter judiciously processed using the Sir Elliot 18 band VST graphic equalizer to produce a somewhat less strident tonality that is more in keeping with the sound of a genuine rainfall.  Particular attention was paid to the enhancement of the distant thunder in the original track.  The signal was thereafter further enhanced using a Freeverb 3 Stereo Enhancer.  The end result of all this tinkering is a lush and realistic (to my ears) stereo sonic experience.

It is rare to get a thunderstorm that is so close and so violent. Some of the thunders in this recording were so loud they clipped a bit on the recording (sorry!). IT really was ground-shaking...

I made this recording with my Zoom H1.
At the start of the recording you can hear me walking away after I have started the recorder. There was a thunder going on, so I waited for that to fade before moving so I did not spoil the recording.
At some point I am also taking photos with my camera. You can hear the servo of the auto-focus, the beeps it makes and the actual camera shutter.

This was a strange storm. Tons of lightning, but only distant thunder. The rain was nearly falling vertically.

Audio description: May 20, 2014. Hail comes in and pounds a deck outside for about a minute or so, then fades and raindrops themselves take prominence. The wind picks up, so you can hear wind chimes going at it and some deep rolling thunder far in the background. If you’ve experienced high winds before, it will probably sound scary to you at volume.

Recorded with a TASCAM DR-05 with a dead cat and no low cut. I got the mics as close to an open window as I could without being ridiculous. Cropped and faded in and out in audacity. No other modifications, so you’ll have to normalize it and equalize to your liking.

This recording consists of 4 samples of rain, and another 3 samples of rain+thunder that I recorded one afternoon.

Equipment used was the inbuilt mics on a Roland R-26, and a Sennheiser ME66 into a Sound Devices 702.  The clips were recorded at 96kHz/24-bit, and they were processed at 48kHz/24-bit.

For processing, I put the samples into Kyma, and crossfaded for texture.

The howling wind sound is an analog-style low pass filter's frequency, level, and resonance being controlled by a Wacom Intuos4 pen/tablet.

The rain slowly swells, which was done by changing parameters of a granular reverb.

The thunder was also controlled by the Wacom tablet, with X, Y, and Z (pressure) dimensions mapped to making the thunder swell in level, density, and texture.

This could have been output in surround, but I don't have that many monitors ;).  This style of ""rain-synthesis"" can also go on indefinitely.

Please let me know what you think of the quality of this track; eg, if it sounds real, if the wind sounds ridiculous, too much thunder, etc.

Use this sound (wherever) if you want to, or let me know if you'd like an mp3 of this, or for it to last longer.  I'd like some credit if you do use it, but it's no big deal.
