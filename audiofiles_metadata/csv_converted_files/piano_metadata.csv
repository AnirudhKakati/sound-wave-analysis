Professional pianos provided clear and natural timbre, while the room's acoustic design minimized noise interference and enhanced sound distribution. Recordings were made using a mobile phone audio recorder to balance performance detail with environmental variability, providing realistic training data.

Description: Piano recordings were captured in the Hervanta Library's piano room, a quiet, echo-prone space ideal for high-quality audio. Professional pianos provided clear and natural timbre, while the room's acoustic design minimized noise interference and enhanced sound distribution. Recordings were made using a mobile phone audio recorder to balance performance detail with environmental variability, providing realistic training data.  

Recording Details: Instruments were played in diverse styles—single-tone for capturing fundamental timbre characteristics like pitch and intensity; multi-tone for harmonic analysis; and ensemble for studying instrument coordination and reverberation. Techniques like legato, staccato, and arpeggio covered a range of dynamics, tonal variations, and rhythmic patterns to enrich the dataset.

Description: Piano recordings were captured in the Hervanta Library's piano room, a quiet, echo-prone space ideal for high-quality audio. Professional pianos provided clear and natural timbre, while the room's acoustic design minimized noise interference and enhanced sound distribution. Recordings were made using a mobile phone audio recorder to balance performance detail with environmental variability, providing realistic training data.  

Recording Details: Instruments were played in diverse styles—single-tone for capturing fundamental timbre characteristics like pitch and intensity; multi-tone for harmonic analysis; and ensemble for studying instrument coordination and reverberation. Techniques like legato, staccato, and arpeggio covered a range of dynamics, tonal variations, and rhythmic patterns to enrich the dataset.

Professional pianos provided clear and natural timbre, while the room's acoustic design minimized noise interference and enhanced sound distribution. Recordings were made using a mobile phone audio recorder to balance performance detail with environmental variability, providing realistic training data.

Techniques like legato, staccato, and arpeggio covered a range of dynamics, tonal variations, and rhythmic patterns to enrich the dataset.

Techniques like legato, staccato, and arpeggio covered a range of dynamics, tonal variations, and rhythmic patterns to enrich the dataset.

Professional pianos provided clear and natural timbre, while the room's acoustic design minimized noise interference and enhanced sound distribution. Recordings were made using a mobile phone audio recorder to balance performance detail with environmental variability, providing realistic training data.  

Recording Details: Instruments were played in diverse styles—single-tone for capturing fundamental timbre characteristics like pitch and intensity; multi-tone for harmonic analysis; and ensemble for studying instrument coordination and reverberation. Techniques like legato, staccato, and arpeggio covered a range of dynamics, tonal variations, and rhythmic patterns to enrich the dataset.

Description: Piano recordings were captured in the Hervanta Library's piano room, a quiet, echo-prone space ideal for high-quality audio. Professional pianos provided clear and natural timbre, while the room's acoustic design minimized noise interference and enhanced sound distribution. Recordings were made using a mobile phone audio recorder to balance performance detail with environmental variability, providing realistic training data.  

Recording Details: Instruments were played in diverse styles—single-tone for capturing fundamental timbre characteristics like pitch and intensity; multi-tone for harmonic analysis; and ensemble for studying instrument coordination and reverberation. Techniques like legato, staccato, and arpeggio covered a range of dynamics, tonal variations, and rhythmic patterns to enrich the dataset.

Professional pianos provided clear and natural timbre, while the room's acoustic design minimized noise interference and enhanced sound distribution. Recordings were made using a mobile phone audio recorder to balance performance detail with environmental variability, providing realistic training data.

Techniques like legato, staccato, and arpeggio covered a range of dynamics, tonal variations, and rhythmic patterns to enrich the dataset.

Description: Piano recordings were captured in the Hervanta Library's piano room, a quiet, echo-prone space ideal for high-quality audio. Professional pianos provided clear and natural timbre, while the room's acoustic design minimized noise interference and enhanced sound distribution. Recordings were made using a mobile phone audio recorder to balance performance detail with environmental variability, providing realistic training data.  

Recording Details: Instruments were played in diverse styles—single-tone for capturing fundamental timbre characteristics like pitch and intensity; multi-tone for harmonic analysis; and ensemble for studying instrument coordination and reverberation.

Description: Piano recordings were captured in the Hervanta Library's piano room, a quiet, echo-prone space ideal for high-quality audio. Professional pianos provided clear and natural timbre, while the room's acoustic design minimized noise interference and enhanced sound distribution. Recordings were made using a mobile phone audio recorder to balance performance detail with environmental variability, providing realistic training data.  

Recording Details: Instruments were played in diverse styles—single-tone for capturing fundamental timbre characteristics like pitch and intensity; multi-tone for harmonic analysis; and ensemble for studying instrument coordination and reverberation. Techniques like legato, staccato, and arpeggio covered a range of dynamics, tonal variations, and rhythmic patterns to enrich the dataset.

Recordings were made using a mobile phone audio recorder to balance performance detail with environmental variability, providing realistic training data.  

Recording Details: Instruments were played in diverse styles—single-tone for capturing fundamental timbre characteristics like pitch and intensity; multi-tone for harmonic analysis; and ensemble for studying instrument coordination and reverberation. Techniques like legato, staccato, and arpeggio covered a range of dynamics, tonal variations, and rhythmic patterns to enrich the dataset.

Description: Piano recordings were captured in the Hervanta Library's piano room, a quiet, echo-prone space ideal for high-quality audio. Professional pianos provided clear and natural timbre, while the room's acoustic design minimized noise interference and enhanced sound distribution. Recordings were made using a mobile phone audio recorder to balance performance detail with environmental variability, providing realistic training data.  

Recording Details: Instruments were played in diverse styles—single-tone for capturing fundamental timbre characteristics like pitch and intensity; multi-tone for harmonic analysis; and ensemble for studying instrument coordination and reverberation. Techniques like legato, staccato, and arpeggio covered a range of dynamics, tonal variations, and rhythmic patterns to enrich the dataset.  

Purpose: The dataset supports audio signal processing tasks like timbre analysis, spectrum decomposition, and instrument recognition, providing a versatile foundation for model training and further musical signal processing research.",http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/,5.28766,"{'preview-hq-mp3': 'https://cdn.freesound.org/previews/775/775410_16697513-hq.mp3', 'preview-hq-ogg': 'https://cdn.freesound.org/previews/775/775410_16697513-hq.ogg', 'preview-lq-mp3': 'https://cdn.freesound.org/previews/775/775410_16697513-lq.mp3', 'preview-lq-ogg': 'https://cdn.freesound.org/previews/775/775410_16697513-lq.ogg'}"

Description: Piano recordings were captured in the Hervanta Library's piano room, a quiet, echo-prone space ideal for high-quality audio. Professional pianos provided clear and natural timbre, while the room's acoustic design minimized noise interference and enhanced sound distribution. Recordings were made using a mobile phone audio recorder to balance performance detail with environmental variability, providing realistic training data.  

Recording Details: Instruments were played in diverse styles—single-tone for capturing fundamental timbre characteristics like pitch and intensity; multi-tone for harmonic analysis; and ensemble for studying instrument coordination and reverberation. Techniques like legato, staccato, and arpeggio covered a range of dynamics, tonal variations, and rhythmic patterns to enrich the dataset.
