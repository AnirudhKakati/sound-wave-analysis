Original recording: Zoom H1, Luhd mics: Two small microphones clipped near the roof of a small greenhouse during light/medium rainfall.\n\nThe gentle pitter-patter of rain falling on the greenhouse creates a soothing symphony that envelops the senses in a cocoon of tranquility. As each droplet makes contact with the glass roof, it produces a soft, rhythmic melody that resonates throughout the enclosed space. The sound is calming and meditative, invoking a sense of peace and serenity within those who are fortunate enough to experience it. The steady cadence of the rain provides a comforting backdrop for reflection and contemplation, allowing one to escape from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. With each passing minute, the sound becomes more hypnotic, lulling listeners into a state of deep relaxation as they surrender themselves to its hypnotic embrace. Rain falling on the greenhouse is not just an auditory delight\u2014it is also a gateway to inner calmness and rejuvenation.",

        "description": "<b>This is peaceful despite the thunder, which is all leisurely and non-threatening. The rain sound itself is subdued from this viewpoint, and accompanied by much trickling sound from run-off water in drainpipes \u2014 a very pleasantly watery soundscape.</b>\n\nWhen I got up on Saturday 28 September 2013 with daylight hardly showing yet, I was aware of some quite heavy rain, but not at all expecting thunder. With the double-glazed windows closed I thought I was also hearing the refuse collectors banging around a bit as I went to get breakfast. Then I saw a flash and got my brain into gear &#8212; not refuse collectors at all: wrong day! Hurried set-up of recorder on bedroom window sill!\n\nThank goodness, although it was early morning there was surprisingly little pronounced traffic noise as I'd expect normally at that time (this is in city centre) &#8212; no doubt because it was a Saturday, and maybe the rain was discouraging some people from setting out so early. So I had surprisingly little to cut out of the recording because of disturbances.\n\nLocation of recording: Exeter city centre, Devon, UK.\n\n<b>Advisory</b>\n\nDespite this being a peaceful soundscape the dynamic range is still pretty large. For a realistic rendition a volume setting of <b>9dB higher</b> than a sensible normal level is necessary. Also, high-grade headphones would generally get the best listening results.\n\n<img alt=\"Setup for this recording (Ouch!)&#8230;\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/130928_bedroom-windowsill-old-recording-setup.jpg\">\n<i>As no sufficiently relevant photo was available, I just took this afternoon shot on 12 July 2023 to show my hilariously precarious setup for all my bedroom window recordings up to my disastrous one on the night of 26-27 May 2017, about more of which just see below&#8230;\n&#8212; Dash! Just noticed. I thought the recorder should be a little more forward, and I now see why. The tripod should be the other way round, with one leg at the rear and the other two at the front!</i>\n\n<b>Techie stuff:</b>\n\nThe recorder was a Sony PCM-M10, with R&#248;de DeadKitten furry windshield (original, superior, light-grey version). It was ill-advisedly (read 'stupidly'!)* placed on a Hama Mini tripod, which is very mini, on my bedroom window sill, raised sufficiently by a stack of books, and with the thick curtain pulled across behind it to minimize sounds from within my flat (and doors also kept closed).\n\n*I say 'ill-advisedly' because in certain circumstances the recorder could easily get pushed or knocked out of the (second-floor) window, with paving stones to fall on below. This did happen with my first PCM D100 in 2017, which taught me not to take chances about that in the future. &#8212; And then I remembered a much chunkier Velbon 'mini' tripod that was languishing in a drawer, and used that with no leg extension and maximum column extension, which took the recorder to just the right height with the legs still fitting on the ledge, the recorder a little further forward, and not a book in sight. That setup was impossible to get pushed out of the window, so since then it's been my standard arrangement for bedroom window recordings.\n\nAs to the fate of that D100 recorder that did hit the paving stone &#8212; that model is, figuratively, built like a tank, and although the (metal) casing was a bit buckled, and it was a little fiddly operating control buttons because the casing was raised a little on top, with some edge gaps, to this day it still works flawlessly. I just regard it as a backup 'extra', and also always use it for bedroom window recordings &#8212; of course with small polythene bag around its body to minimize ingress of dust, water and prying little beasties. So, yes, you could say I have a fond 'special relationship' with that recorder, which is my elite bedroom-window thunderstorm one.\n\nPost-recording processing was EQ in Audacity to correct for muffling caused by the furry windshield, and to correct for a quite strong 'alcove resonance' in the low bass, which any recorder picks up there. Subsequent processing was in A1 Stereo Control VST plugin to widen and sharpen the stereo image (160%).\n\n<b>Please remember to give this recording a rating &#8212; Thank you! <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\"></b>",

The heavy rain was followed by thunder, then transforms into softer rain that lets you hear faint city sounds like cars, doors closing, someone using a screwdriver, voices, the bells of a nearby church, airplanes and birds. There's so much to hear, I couldn't stop recording. I only took out some little peaks caused by the movement of my ear.",

The rain is striking three different surfaces in this track: cement, roofing and plantlife. Now, I'm no pro, nor is my equipment (Olympus WS-310M w/ built in mic), so discerning these different sounds is difficult. You can hear the dripping from Rain: Fast Drip in the background of this track. However slight, there is also a noticeable electronic note which is simultaneous with the water striking these surfaces. You can also hear slight rustling sounds that could be wind or my shirt moving near the mic (I was wearing the device on a lanyard). The file is wav, recorded in stereo at 16 bit at 44.1Mhz.",

I put an echo with a decay factor of 0,4 and a delay time of 0,8 seconds. Then I created a new stereo track that I put just under the first track. I generated a pink noise with a amplify of -26,7dB.I also changed the pitch and put a C:4 and a E:2 with a semitones of -19,73.I put the frequency to 266,667Hz to 85,333Hz. Finally I put a tremolo effect. I choosed a sine form and the beginning phase at -100 and the traited level at 1. The frequency was at 4,0Hz.I made this to create a soundscape in addition to the rain's sound.",

Strangely enough spring like weather hit us in Michigan during the middle of our snow season, so we've had a lot of rain lately. I figured I'd try the same set-up I used for recording snow, but for rain instead. It was also trash day in our subdivision so you might hear some distant garbage trucks and the usual traffic hum of the Motor City ( The nick name for Detroit, MI). The rain hitting the plastic liner about 3 inches above the mic, sort of sounds like a crackling from a fire to me, which I thought was kind of cool.\n\nBesides editing out the beginning and end of the track, it's uncut. Not sure if I'll use it on my YouTube Channel, but you're more then welcomed to use it how you see fit.

At the center of the roof is a plexiglass dome which makes a bit of a different sound from the rest of the roof. The rain is actually dripping off a tree which is why it is so loud. The low roar in the background is a combination of wind at the top of the trees and the ocean surf in the distance. In this recording the mic is pretty close to the roof, about nine feet from the floor. Can be looped.",

You hear rain on the driveway, rain coming down a gutter, and drops hitting the roof only inchies away from the microphone -- all at the same time. This sample is \"folded\" on itself -- the second half is a mirror of the first half. For that reason, it can be easily looped to make it as long as you need it; the end will seamlessly match up with the beginning.",

Around 6' and 13' I have also put single hits that help to re-focus if your mind has started to wander.\r\n\r\nThe rain sound has two advantages: first it is nice :-) then it acts like a white noise and isolates from noisy environments.\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy!\r\n\r\nThe rain sound is from\r\n<a href=\"http://www.freesound.org/people/tenbensons/sounds/72086/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.freesound.org/people/tenbensons/sounds/72086/</a>\r\nwhich is a remix of\r\n<a href=\"http://www.freesound.org/people/barredowl/sounds/20129/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.freesound.org/people/barredowl/sounds/20129/</a>\r\nand the bell is from\r\n<a href=\"http://www.freesound.org/people/fauxpress/sounds/42095/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.freesound.org/people/fauxpress/sounds/42095/</a>",

The loud dripping sound is from the water running off of the secondary carport and hitting the cement driveway of my Louisiana home. You can hear more rain in the background. The background rain is muffled a little because it was hitting the roof of the carport. I used my Olympus WS-310M w/ its built-in stereo mics for this recording. This file is wav and was recorded with 16bit at 44.1hz.",

The low roar in the background is a combination of wind at the top of the trees and the ocean surf in the distance. In this recording the mic is about five feet above the floor. Can be looped.",

        "description": "In the small hours of 28th June 2012 it was raining a bit here in central Exeter, UK (which very rarely has thunderstorms), and I heard an occasional very distant boom of thunder. Just in case the storm was going to develop more and come over, I set up my Sony PCM-M10 raised up on a window ledge in my bedroom and set it going at 02.50, getting back into bed and leaving it to to capture whatever it would.\n\nI'd set the recording level very low in order not to have any close lightning strikes clipped, but I needn't have worried about that because all I got was a recording of the gentle rain (only just audible) plus the more noticeable trickling of rainwater off my roof, with the occasional sound of seagulls and an almost constant deep muttering and mumbling of thunder at or just beyond the limit of audibility (you need speakers / headphones with extended low bass response to hear much of it), and with the very occasional more distinctly audible but still very quiet booms of thunder. Because of the low recording level, my normalizing the file to a genuinely representative level has meant a very considerable amplification, and I was thus really surprised how well it came out. \n\nAs the thunder was receding and the rain / trickling sounds gradually reducing while the recorder was running, after some half-hour I terminated the recording (enviously seeing extremely frequent lightning flashing far away to the south-east, meaning the storm was entertaining people somewhere else and not coming my way at all), and subsequently I cut off the last bit of the recording to improve the overall effect.\n\nActually that storm system remained virulently active through the day, causing widespread havoc especially in the Midlands and northern England, with flash floods, local large hail and the odd tornado. What I had missed! :-(\n\nSo, this recording is a non-event as a thunderstorm recording but is still a nice bit of quiet 'atmosphere'. The seagulls are mostly Herring Gull, but with some Lesser Black-backed Gull. The latter have a similar range of sounds to the Herring Gull, but with distinctively reedy or hoarse-sounding voice.\n\nPlease note that the volume level of this recording has been carefully adjusted for listening purposes, and ALL my recordings so far are meant to be listened to with a volume setting that would give a realistic level for playback of CLASSICAL music (a large but not exceptional symphony orchestra). If you have the right volume setting, you should not need to change that setting from one recording of mine to another.\n<p><b>Please remember to give this recording a rating! <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\"></b></p>",

Rain ebbing and swelling on a house with aluminum siding and an aluminum canopy.  I think what makes this recording good is, the rain is not solid all the time. As you will see from the graphic, and when you listen to the audio, there are periods of heavy rain, periods of light rain, and often periods of no rain.\n\nRecorded in southern Illinois on Tuesday April 16 2024.\n\nEquipment-  Sound Devices MixPre 3-II\n Microphone-  Sennheiser MKH 8020 Omnidirectional microphone",

        "description": "This stereo recording was made on November 23, 2014 in Grays Harbor Washington during a rare thunderstorm. The clip contains rain falling on a wooden deck and recurring peals of thunder both near and far.\r\n\r\nThis original recording was made using a ZOOM H-6 Handy Recorder with ZOOM stereo XY microphone. The track was edited in Audacity 2.0.6 to remove a few artifacts. Total run time for this WAV file is: 8:29.\r\n\r\nThis is my first upload. I am hearing impaired and new to field audio recording. I am fascinated by this art form and hearing sounds that I haven\u2019t been able to hear in twenty years. I would greatly appreciate your feedback on the quality of my work and, if you choose to use this in a project, the end use you have in mind.\r\n",

Since this was a longer uninterrupted recording it may have captured my dorm mates going up the stairs, eventual cars. It was recorded at 3:00am so the unwanted noises are minimal.\nSome thunders have REALLY LOUD LOWS so be careful.\nEnjoy!",

        "description": "Gentle rain on paving increases to moderate at 1:02 after being announced by a well timed thunder. Sounds like I increased the gain on the amp, but the rain actually came down harder. Listen carefully at 0:59 and you can hear a pre-clap (sounds quite wooden). I will upload the uncompressed version if anyone is interested. 320 kbps mp3 is, on the other hand, indistinguishable from the uncompressed version IMO.

Gradually sounds of birds, monkeys and insects are added to the ficcion. Suddenly this environment is interrupted by the sound of footsteps, human voices and trees cutters. After the crash of a fallen tree there is a decrease in the environment sounds. \r\n\r\nThen rain starts and you can hear the sound of frogs and some distant thunder. A human voice sings a ritual chant: another Amazon tree has been destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe sounds of water, wind, light rain and machines have been drawn from different patches made with Pure date. The sounds of frogs, birds, monkeys and insects are from Freesound. We have done the steps with Foley and the song has been recorded live\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://barcelona.freesound.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://barcelona.freesound.org</a>\n<a href=\"http://www.kiics.eu/en/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.kiics.eu/en/</a>",

Details - My front veranda roof is tin and it was raining so I stood under it holding a Rode NT4 mic in close proximity to the underside of the roof. Filtering this sound will change the perceived roof type. This is a stereo recording. The NT4 was connected to an Edirol R-09 mic-in (15 level setting).",

As I couldn't build a 'head-mount' I used the lid from some kitchen tile adhesive- cut a hole in the centre and fitted one half of my Sony 'micro-stereo lapel mic through the hole. With the lid creating a 'baffle between the two poles, I then held the mic like a table tennis bat. Recorded onto a Sharp MD-MT80 at around half past seven on the 9th Nov on the pavement outside my house in York England. It was raining lightly and there was a slight breeze (heard on the track as a rumble). Right on cue, an ambulance came speeding past, obviously going to the aid of someone who fell foul of the poor weather. ",

I only got some lovely drain sounds, and some rain, blustery wind and a few window rattles..\r\n\r\nRecorded in a long lean-to conservatory. 40mm Multiwall polycarbonate roof, single glazed windows to front, Mic left end facing front.\r\n \r\nElaborate drain-pipe system on left side going down to diverter in greenhouse, front, then along gulley just outside-left and then in to floor-level drain  (back,left). 'Plops' left/back/down. 'Trickling' from gutter and drainpipes to the front and left. Rain on roof diffuse, mainly up and right.\r\n\r\nLoses quite a lot of detail using the built-in player's MP3 lossy compression.\r\nBest downloaded, and played using headphones.\r\n\r\nGreat reference recording to test headphones for their binaural imaging capabilities, to see if they do up/down, front/back, and distance resolution, as well as the usual right/left/spaciousness thingies.

It works best with noises or other deep sounds.\n\nI think if you add a little bit of that sound to other audio file you can get very spezial sound for ambiante.\n\nI will add similar sound as a only vocal too.\n\nAs always i wish you a good work and if you crated something, so please let me  listen! Thank you!",

Recorded on a Zoom H5.\n\nThere are also some household sounds swimming around in the background, doors closing, dishes clinking etc;  I think you can hear the radio or something very faintly towards the end -- but there's plenty of clean usable thunder and rain in there.\n\nIncidentally I often use this type of thing in my long-form instrumental music, produced under the name conelrad. I have a podcast of album-length instrumental music which comes out every other week, called conelcast. Check it out wherever you get podcasts or at <a href=\"http://conelrad.co.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\">conelrad.co.uk</a> if that kinda thing interests you.",

White noise passed through an SVF filter. In each channel, the filter cut is slightly different. Subsequent equalization.\n- The noise of drops falling on an umbrella. Initial random noise texture obtained by experimenting with delay. The original sample is a female scream. The resulting texture is loaded into the granulator. Thus, the final texture of the drops breaking on the umbrella is obtained. Subsequent equalization.\n- The noise of drops falling on the grass. The original random noise texture is also obtained by experimenting with delay. The original sample is a female scream. The resulting texture is loaded into the granulator. Thus, the final texture of the droplets falling on the grass is obtained. Subsequent equalization.\n- Sounds of bubbles from drops in puddles. Obtained from the sound of a sinusoid, to which manipulations with the pitch and envelope of the amplitude are applied. Next, a random sequence of separate sounds is created, each of which has its own pitch.\n- The noise of water. White noise passed through a band pass filter. Further, to create the impression of droplets falling on a wet hard surface, a Filter Freak filter with cut modulation was applied.\n- Again, the noise of drops falling on an umbrella, a little lower in tone. White noise passed through the band pass filter, then the Filter Freak filter is applied, with modulation of the cutoff. Subsequent equalization.\n To add naturalness, also the volume of almost all sounds has a constant modulation in small limits. Thus, a very flexible patch of rain was obtained, the intensity of which can be changed in a fairly wide limits with one macro regulator.",

I hit record slightly too late to catch the first couple of bell rings, but got most of it.  First we hear the church signal 8pm, then we hear the courthouse do the same thing.  Also some wind in the trees right above the mic, some rain, a bit of thunder, and some cars in a small town.   Also a huge truck with loud engine that sounds almost like thunder towards the end, in fact it was mixed with thunder at one moment.  Captured with maudio delta1010LT soundcard. ",

Blended all tracks to get this recording.  Kind of a primitive 360\u00b0 surround thing to see what it would turn out like.  Front and rear mics were both set at 120\u00b0, so not exactly in correct phase, but it's doable.  The crawlspace in the attic was approx. 4 feet high, and all mic's were roughly 8 inches beneath the plywood roof, trusses and shingles.  Faint sounds of water splashing came through the eaves and were a result of water running off the roof and splashing into flowerbeds and onto driveway.  Probably should have blocked the eaves while recording, but this was just an initial experiment to see what I would change for next recording in the attic.",

It picks up much less bass from the distant road noise, and has less of a stereo image for the medium distance forest noises. It feels a bit more 'intimate' than the omni recording, but loses a broader sense of location. It tends to bring near sounds into sharp focus. \n\nSee my other sounds for the omni recording.",

        "description": "It's a long field recording of an intense thunderstorm that took place in Warsaw, Polad 2012-06-21 around 4 AM.\r\n\r\nYou can hear a lot of thunder strikes from all directions, some rain noise in the background, sometimes a car passing by on a wet road somewhere beneath. Also after the closest strikes, some car alarms are becoming audible too.\r\n\r\nOne strike peaked at 0dB with minimum gain used. I got clip indicator lit on one channel.\r\n\r\nSome thunders are so close and clean, they sound like a giant electrig gas igniter.\r\n\r\nI've never had so many this good thunder shots recorded. This file is a gold mine for all your thunderstorm sound needs.\r\n\r\nI'm uploading raw recording. Not edited and not normalized. It's only converted to FLAC for saving on file size. The quality's there :)\r\n\r\nThe recording starts in a middle of the thunderstorm, whitch is slowly starting to fade away.\r\n\r\nI recorded this from a high flat's balcony using a hand-held Zoom H2's rear stereo XY mics (120 deg. of spread). Using no dynamics processor of filter, with mic gain set to low (minimum).\r\n\r\nOriginally it was a stereo 48-kHz, 24-bit WAV file. Examined and converted to 24-bit FLAC using Audacity.\r\n\r\nI hope you'll enjoy this recording as much as I did making it.",

        "description": "Actually is not rain. It is snow melting down from a roof, falling into puddles and onto a corrugated roof. I placed the microphone (Zoom H2) on different spots in 4channel sorround mode. I just normalized them and mixed them into stereo. Thats it. \r\n\r\nHere the mic is placed nearer to the roof, so the impact of the drops sounds a little sharper. \r\n\r\nfeel free to vote and leave a comment, maybe letting me know where you are going to use it :)\r\n\r\nYou can easily loop the sound without a notable cut in the mix. \r\n\r\ncheers, pillo",
