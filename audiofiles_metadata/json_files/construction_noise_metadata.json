The masts are locked by steel ropes that do not unlock easy enough, so they have to use a cutting torch. When the cable break, the pole fall down with a lot of noise. \r\nAfter the vessel is unlocked, the tug boat locks onto the small working platform and navigates away.\r\n(The dialect the workman speak is from the Nijmegen Arnhem region)\r\n\r\nSorry for mic rumble sometimes caused by me rearranging the tripod I have to use. \r\n\r\nThe goal of the Dutch '<b>'Room for the River Programme'</b> is to give the river more room to be able to manage higher water levels. At more than 30 locations, measures will be taken that give the river space to flood safely. Moreover, the measures will be designed in such a way that they improve the quality of the immediate surroundings. The Room for the River programme will be completed by approximately 2015. <a href=\"http://www.ruimtevoorderivier.nl/english/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Follow this English link for more information and video's.

They had a very hard time understanding what I was saying, and later they told me that they are almost half-deaf because of working with noisy equipment without any protective gear. MORAL OF THE STORY IS: LOOK AFTER YOUR EARS, PEOPLE! Recorded with Zoom H4n.Please rate, comment and share. In case you download some of my sounds and use them in your audiovisual artwork, the only thing I ask from you is to let me know where and how they ended up. It would be a pleasure. Please feel free to send me a private message if you have any questions or suggestions. I really try to keep an open mind for everything. Thank you. Peace. Matt ",

From time to time, you can hear their voices, some cars passing by in the street, and an alarm (starting at 1\u201931\u2019\u2019). At the end of the recording, the workers stop their engine and throw some broken pieces of concrete, stones, and other things in a nearby container. \nRecorded in April 2021 with an Olympus LS-P4 and a Rode Stereo videomic X (SVMX). \nFade in/out applied in Audacity.",

        "description": "Ambient stereo recording of a large 1/4 mile long rope making machine/ building with traveling carriage which is used to create rope. \n\nThis recording is 32 bit float and has not been normalised. A zoom H4e was used with an XY stereo pair. \n\n00:02 a bell rings which is connected to a signal rope at the other end of the 1/4 mile long building to tell an operator to start the machine\n\n00:05 the machine starts\n\n00:14 the machine stops \n\n00:14 to end you hear handling of wooden stands which separate the yarns used to make the rope\n\nYou may use this recording for non commercial purposes. Attribution would be great as I would love (more from personal interest) to see how my recording is used.

Even if it sounds less realistic to my ears, it may add some nice bassy flavour that one might like in some circumstance ! \nRecorded in Nanterre (suburbs of Paris, France), in September 2023 with an Olympus LS-3 (internal microphones, TRESMIC system on). \nFade in/out applied in audacity.",

        "description": "The drill sound effect is a high-pitched, piercing sound that is produced by a power drill when it is rotating. The sound is caused by the friction between the drill bit and the material being drilled. The pitch and loudness of the sound will vary depending on the type of drill bit, the speed of the drill, and the material being drilled.\n\nThe drill sound effect is often used in music, film, television, video games, and advertising to create a sense of urgency, danger, or excitement. It can also be used to create a sense of realism, such as in a scene where a character is using a power drill to build or repair something.\n\nHere is a more detailed description of the drill sound effect:\n\n    Pitch: The drill sound effect is a high-pitched sound, typically in the range of 2,000 to 10,000 Hz. The pitch of the sound will vary depending on the speed of the drill and the type of drill bit.\n    Loudness: The drill sound effect can be very loud, depending on the type of drill and the material being drilled. It is important to wear ear protection when using a power drill, especially if you are going to be using it for an extended period of time.\n    Duration: The drill sound effect can be short or long, depending on how long the drill is being used. A short burst of the drill sound effect can be used to create a sense of urgency or excitement, while a longer drill sound effect can be used to create a sense of realism or to build suspense.\n\nThe drill sound effect is a versatile sound effect that can be used in a variety of contexts. It is a powerful and effective way to create a sense of urgency, danger, excitement, or realism.",

Everything around is covered with snow, which absorbs all sounds very well. Right in front of us, 200m away, there is a road with leisurely traffic. Behind the road, 350-400 meters away, you can hear the noise of a construction site and hammer blows, which are reflected from nearby buildings. To the sides and straight ahead we hear the distant voices of passers-by.\nRecorded in park, named after the 50th anniversary of the All-Union Lenin Communist Youth Union in the city of Ekaterinburg (Russia)\nRecorded January , 2024 on Tascam DR-05x, with post processing.",

In the back-ground some birds and a caw. \r\nThis recording is like I was lying there with my ear on the wooden quay when I was young (and that's long ago ;) . I like the result of this experiment. \r\n\r\nThe two 5cm piezo's are clamped on two separate parts of the quay. \r\nRecorded with Sony PCM D50 recorder and EQ with Audacity-software.\r\n\r\nHanging the piezo in the river did not give a great recording. Clamping them on the quay gave a much better result because the two parts of wooden quay functioned as a stereo sound-booster. To get rid of the noise above the water I have to find or make a large underwater construction along the shore.\r\n \r\nWhen you use this sound it would be nice if you spent a voluntarily donation to freesound.  \r\nYOU ALWAYS HAVE TO CREDIT/ATTRIBUTE me (klankbeeld) and freesound.org in your work if you use this sound.

Zenith Consoltone.\nOnly because the FAQ says so: Electro Voice N/D 257A through impedance transformer into crappy Gigabyte motherboard Realtek High Definition Audio. 16bits, processed at 32bits. Audacity sound editor and/or driver wouldn't record mic level so it was very noisy after amplification. Filtered with a (mathematically equivalent) FFT constructed whopping 64k length zero phase filter (Blackman window) with 5 wavelength width bandpass at each harmonic from 60Hz to 5,520Hz. For some reason a fraction of some of the harmonics didn't get through so did another pass on the residual noise and mixed that in. Near the beginning there was a sort of brief duplicate signal that descended in pitch so it didn't make it through the filter. I added that bit in. Attenuated frequencies above 3.6kHz because they are pretty much noise, but removing them didn't sound right. Cleaned up the beginning a bit in various ways, cut it down to 15 sec and carefully appended the unfiltered \"click\" onto the end, which I denoised 12dB with Audacity's noise reduction.",

Sometimes some people. After 16 minutes the wonderful and clear low death bell of the st. Jan Cathedral 800m away for the rest of the recording. A single common chaffinch sings his song. Sometimes a little wind in the trees.\n\n\n\n<b>History</b> \nThe Citadel in 's-Hertogenbosch is a former fort located on the Citadellaan, within walking distance of the city center. This fort was built between 1637 and 1645.\n\nAt the place where the Citadel was built, houses stood in the 14th and 15th century. Of these, remains were found in 1983 in archaeological research. This gate dates from the period between 1315 and 1350. Because of the construction of this gate, the 'Brusselse Poort' was redundant.\n\nThe citadel was a fortress with five points in the bastion. The construction of the fort was started shortly after the capture of the city in 1629. The fort was named Fort Willem Maria, names of two of the children of Prince Frederick Henry of Orange, who had conquered the city on the Spaniards.\n\nTo give the fort a free field of fire, the Ortheneind district was demolished, together with St. Peter and Paul's church. The area whose buildings were flattened occupied about 4 hectares. The northern access road to the city also went via the Citadel along the northern and southern gate of the building.\n\nThe firing field that was created by this was called De Plein.

An undirected story from the Netherlands. To hear you first have to listen.\n\n<b>EXTRA History of Moerdijk</b>\n\nBefore 1421, when the St. Elisabethflood flooded the northwestern part of Brabant and the southern part of Holland and made all habitation impossible for centuries, this area belonged to the county of Strijen. That lay West of the Dongen to across the Hollands Diep, which did not exist then, but still remains from that flood.\n\nA part of Strijen was separated in 1361 as the fiefdom II \u201cNiervaart\u201d Its border is still the division between the municipalities of Zwaluwe and Klundert, which used to be called Niervaart. How far the flood in Brabant after 1421 covered the land, we can still trace. The division between clay and sandy soil runs roughly from Geertruidenberg over Wagenberg and Zevenbergen, north of Oudenbosch, Gastel and Steenbergen. That dividing line indicates that. As soon as possible, reclamation began again. In Klundert the dike along the Hollands Diep was laid in 1558 and in Zwaluwe the dike of the Royale polder along the Hollands Diep was completed about 1650.\n\nThe name Moerdijk is typical of its location: \u201ca marsh on the dike.\u201d Moer is swamp, muddy ground, in which there is a lot of peat. In Zeeland and North-West Brabant, even before 1421, large parts of the soil were flooded by seawater at high tide, i.e. twice a day. So that soil also contained a lot of salt. Salt and peat were therefore extracted and often a dike was constructed, to make the work easier and safer to do. That was then a swamp dike. And the work was often called: moor-diking.\n\nThe wide waters of the Hollands Diep presented an ugly obstacle for traffic between Holland and Brabant. A ferry provided the connection between Brabant and Holland. Berth to the north was Strijensas and berth to the south was a place, which developed into a hamlet, which came to be called Moerdijk.\n\nThus, the first beginnings of Moerdijk mainly consisted of a ferry and post house.\n\nJohan Willem Friso, Prince of Orange drowned during his crossing from Moerdijk to Strijensas on July 14, 1711. Moerdijk was a very important link in the North-South connection.\n\nA \u201cPost Road\u201d ran from Antwerp to Moerdijk and from Breda to Moerdijk. The end of the ferry across the Hollands Diep, through which Rotterdam was connected to Antwerp had become a street road after 1800 under Napoleon and had been completed in 1822. Napoleon's intention had been a connection between Paris and Amsterdam. In this, the Hollands Diep remained the great inconvenience.\n\nThis became much better, when in 1845 a Belgian Company laid a railroad from Antwerp to 't Hollands Diep: the \u201cGrand Belge\u201d with Moerdijk as terminus. In connection with this faster traffic, a steamboat service then came across the Hollands Diep to replace the former shipping. And also a better loading and unloading place became necessary. The harbor was built and completed in 1858 (that\u2019s where I recorded this track).\n\nAs the terminus of that great highway, there was work for workers in Moerdijk. About 50 men earned a weekly wage on \u201cthe Belge.\u201d This was abolished in 1879 with the establishment of the Holland Iron Railway in 1872. This ran over the new bridge, thus literally and figuratively leaving Moerdijk behind.\n\nThe Moerdijk fishermen lived off the smelt trade. Part of the smelt went to London and another part was exported to Paris. The Moerdijk smokers often went up the Rhine, often as far as Germany, because the higher up the river one went, the bigger the catch.\n\nIn the glory days of fishing, there was already a large freezing facility. As of 1970, the Moerdijk fishery is no longer there. Because of the Delta Works, all that is history.\n\nUnder the pressure of the emerging automobile, it was decided in 1909 to put into service an official ferry service from Willemsdorp to Moerdijk, thus connecting the Netherlands above and below the Moerdijk.\n\nThe state took over the Moerdijk-Willemsdorp steamboat service in 1928, operated three modern ferries. That gave traffic and income. But faster and faster people wanted to travel. On December 12, 1936, the road bridge was opened. But again Moerdijk was \u201cleft behind.\u201d The middle class suffered a major blow.\n\nMoerdijk also had a large soap factory, which had previously been a flour factory. And then there was the De Korte brothers' shipyard, which employed a hundred and thirty men. This shipyard went bankrupt during the crisis period.\n\nMoerdijk was also very important from a strategic point of view. The Germans dropped their paratroopers near the bridges and near the village on May 10, 1940. During the liberation of Moerdijk on November 9, 1944, much was destroyed. Already on l7 September a part of Moerdijk was wiped off the map by a bombardment.\n\nFifty-five percent of the village was totally destroyed. Thirty-five percent was very badly damaged and the remaining ten percent was lightly damaged.\n\nFar from recovering from the devastation in 1944, Moerdijk was hit less than ten years later by a natural disaster of unprecedented magnitude, the water disaster of February 1, 1953\n(This information comes from the Moerdijk Municipal Heritage Society).\n\n<a href=\"https://freesound.org/search/?q=klankbeeld+moerdijk+240730+0867&amp;f=&amp;s=Automatic+by+relevance&amp;si_tags=0&amp;si_name=0&amp;si_description=0&amp;si_packname=0&amp;si_sound_id=0&amp;si_username=0&amp;d0=0&amp;d1=*&amp;ig=0&amp;r=0&amp;g=0&amp;dp=0&amp;cm=0&amp;mm=0\" rel=\"nofollow\">More tracks here today</a> / <a href=\"https://freesound.org/search/?q=klankbeeld+harbour&amp;f=&amp;s=Rating+%28highest+first%29&amp;si_tags=0&amp;si_name=0&amp;si_description=0&amp;si_packname=0&amp;si_sound_id=0&amp;si_username=0&amp;d0=0&amp;d1=*&amp;ig=0&amp;r=0&amp;g=0&amp;dp=0&amp;cm=0&amp;mm=0\" rel=\"nofollow\">More harbour recordings</a>\n\nDate/time: July 30 2024, 1:06 PM\n\nWeather: 28-30, clouds 10%, wind E NNE 9 km/h max 14 km/h, 1016 hPa, humidity 42-50%, dew point 17c, visibility 33 km\n\nLocation; village harbor Moerdijk, Den Bels, Moerdijk, Noord-Brabant, Netherlands (Holland), Europe.

This file is an edit of the full recording.  It contains two bursts of jackhammering, one fairly short and one longer.  The background noise is the sound of the air compressor.  Toward the end the compressor is turned off and the last of the pressure is released by the jackhammer as it sort of \"putters out\". This last bit is a bit unique",

Equalizers, filters, samplers, reverbs and other effects and treatments were also used. Hope this will be helpful to you. Enjoy.

When constructing this atmosphere, the following were used: the sounds of a cracked walnut (prepared beyond recognition), the sound of hitting an oil heater (only looped sustain was used). Equalizers, filters, samplers, reverbs and other effects and treatments were also used. Hope this will be helpful to you. Enjoy. If it does not bother you, share links to your work where this sound was used.\nSee more in folders:\nDrone.Atmosphere.Texture <a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/packs/36415/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/packs/36415/</a>\nAmbience.Design <a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/packs/38223/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/packs/38223/</a>\nDesigned.Misc <a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/packs/37984/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/packs/37984/</a>",

The Sony PCM-D100 for recording is set up about 80 meters from the construction site on a road on which the construction vehicles drive back and forth. Various trucks, forklifts, voices, circular saws, screwdrivers, and other noises from the construction site can be heard next to birdsong in the forest. A multiband compressor is softly used to slightly increase the typical frequencies of the construction activity and a limiter, which was rarely used. The wind noises were cut off with a 75 Hz fiter, but sporadic clipping occurred due to lack of wind protection. Neither reverb nor delay effects were used. All this is provided by nature.",

        "description": "Long recording of a journey with the old historical streetcar in Porto (line 18, Carmo to Massarelos). Waiting at the stop in the beginning, already sitting in the streetcar. Driving woman explaining something to a customer in Portuguese. After 20 seconds rattling noises of the vehicle, engine starting, and the tram starts moving. Rattling of the wheels on the rail, the whole vehicle shaking, creaking, groaning and squeaking of the old wooden and metal construction. Shortly after a loud howling sound of the engine (0:33) is drowning out almost everything else. Streetcar stopping several times, sometimes for longer intervals (e.g. at 2:37, 5:26, 9:09) and then starting again (3:11, 6:27, 9:48). After 1:34 you can hear a very nice sequence of metallic clicking noises, rattling and hissing. The engine getting really loud round 2:10. Beeping at 3:40 from electronic ticket machine. After 9:10 rattling of some metal sheets. In between again and again the howling of the engine (4:10, 7:22, 10:20). During the last one I was getting out of the vehicle and pointed the microphone near the engine, so you hear it especially loud there. Afterthis the tram is driving away, faint traffic noise and seagulls screaming. \nRecorded with Zoom Handy Recorder H2 with built-in W-XY cardioid-type stereo microphone.\n",

The sounds of chewing were audible from nearby so I decided to rig up the microphones to see what I could detect. The mics were placed about 3 inches from the nest itself - yes, I am that brave! (Or stupid...)\n\nThe high sensitivity of my setup did cause clipping on some of the chewing sounds, but I don't feel it affects the end result. As this was in an urban setting, there are some other sounds present - a dog barking, birds and the passing of cars in the distance.\n\nPost-recording processing:\nResampled from 24-bit to 16-bit, no other changes.\n\nRecorded using a pair of Electro-voice RE27 N/D microphones feeding a home-made balanced low noise preamp, which in turn feeds a Steinberg UR22 MkII USB audio interface.",

Waiting at the stop in the beginning, tram comes and stops for one and a half minute. People getting in (a few old woman, two families with children). Beeping of the electronic ticket machine. Traffic noises in the background (the rails go parallel to a big street). 1:10: Engine starts with a loud howling sound. 1:26: Tram starts moving. Rattling of the wheels on the rail, the whole vehicle shaking, creaking, groaning and squeaking of the old wooden and metal construction. Children talking to their father all the time in the background. Streetcar stopping several times, sometimes for longer intervals (e.g. at 4:00, 7:18, 8:28, 9:15) and then starting again (5:00, 8:05, 9:00, 9:30,11:22, 17:10). In between again the howling of the engine (5:43, 10:18). Loud rattling at 8:16. 8:13: Little boy is saying \u201cSou eu conductor\u201d (= \u201c I\u2019m the driver\u201d). Round 9:20 older woman is talking loud in Portuguese, children screaming. Round 10:18 and especially from 11:54 to ~12:30 the streetcar is getting fast with the engine going even louder. At 19:13 horns of an ambulance.\nRecorded with Roland Edirol R-09 digital recorder and Edirol CS-15 cardioid-type stereo microphone.\n",

At the time, I was unable to find any recorded sounds of the appropriate length or acoustic; so I constructed my own.  The engine noise is a mix down, with various Audition filters applied, of a domestic Dyson vacuum cleaner, two industrial carpentry workshop vacuum cleaners and a dust extractor vent recording.\r\nThe ATC voices are of actors voices suitably EQ'ed.  The whole scene lasted about five minutes.  As we were short of operators, I ran both lights and sound together through the computer sound cueing program (SFX), which we use; and that enabled me to merge my sound with the LX-changes.",

It is quite faint in the recording.\r\n\r\nThe sound was a distant metallic hammering, repeating monotonously at regular intervals.\r\nIt went on for several minutes, so there was enought time for me to go and get the recorder and place it outside to capture it.\r\nOnly when I got outside I realized it was actually raining, that is why I cut my recording short.\r\n\r\nIn total, I believe the hammering went on for over 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nCould it be burglars breaking into a house or a garage? - It took too long and made far too much noise. The noise seemed to be pretty (a few blocks away), must have been quite loud closer, especially at that time of night when everything is quite.\r\n\r\nMAybe it was a sound comming from construction works or an industrial site, much farther away...",

No additional processing was applied.\r\n\r\nSounds captured include many \"tweaks\", sferics and static from distant lightning, background hiss, some hints of \"chorus\" and warbling noise barely discernible above the noise floor, low-level 60 Hz AC hum and some of its accompanying harmonics from the many above-ground electric utility lines that crisscross the open landscape, as well as some minor mast microphonics (especially in the right channel) due to light winds.\r\n\r\nThe WR-9STL receiver itself was designed and constructed by Stephen McGreevy (<a href=\"http://www.auroralchorus.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.auroralchorus.com</a>).  It was connected to an identical pair of two-turn delta loop antennas erected on 10 m masts with reception areas of approximately 200 sq m oriented to magnetic east-west (left channel) and north-south (right channel), respectively, and spaced a few mast lengths apart to try to minimize coupling.  Recording was made directly from the receiver using the line inputs of a Fostex FR-2LE recorder with Oade Bros Super MOD.",

The truck approaches, sounding its mechanical siren, then stops, deploys the hose, and starts pumping water. The pump works and water sprays for the rest of the clip (this bit should be easy to loop with any sound editor if you want the spraying to last longer.) No voices, fire or other noise (IRL there would be several human operators.)\n\nNo attribution requirements, but if you do use it I'd be interested to know about it! Share and enjoy.",

        "description": "Long recording of a journey with the old historical streetcar in Porto (line 22, Pra\u00e7a de Batalha to Carmo). Rattling noises of the vehicle, engine starting, and the tram starts moving. Rattling of the wheels on the rail, the whole vehicle shaking, creaking, groaning and squeaking of the old wooden and metal construction. Shortly after a loud howling sound of the engine (0:24) is drowning out almost everything else. At 0:53 and 4:18 bell that tells the driver to stop at the next stop (the bell hangs in front of the vehicle and is ringed by pulling a cord, that goes along the ceiling through the whole car). Streetcar stopping several times, sometimes for longer intervals (e.g. at 1:08, 2:07, 4:10, 5:11) and then starting again (1:28, 2:30, 4:26, 5:27). Beeping at 2:20 from electronic ticket machine. After 6:00 some interesting metallic squeaking noises when the tram has to drive a turn. After that it stops, people are getting out. In the very end you here the sound of some metal sheet, that is the driver changing sign, that says where the tram is going in front of the vehicle. Throughout the whole recording people talking and faint traffic noise in the background. \nRecorded with Zoom Handy Recorder H2 with built-in W-XY cardioid-type stereo microphone.\n",

At the beginning of the file, one can hear a lady moving through the library and arranging some books. Later, she will come back with a colleague to set something. In the background, beeps from the counter and distant conversations can be heard, as well as some noise from outside (beeps from a construction machine, a bird, and a police siren toward the end) coming through an open window. \nRecorded in June 2023 with an Olympus LS-P4 and Immersive Soundscapes EarSight Binaural microphones. \nFade in/out and high pass filter at 60Hz -6dB/oct applied in Audacity. \n(If you want to use this sound as a mono audio file, you may have to delete one channel to avoid phase issues).",

That's really quite odd to me, because I was expecting the Blues chime to counter the melancholy sound of the Gypsy chime in contemplative mood, but what actually happened was that the Blues chime in this context was sad itself! I brought in the particular small bamboo chime (in two layers) to give a contrasting timbre and also to lighten-up the atmosphere, which it does.</b>\n\n<b>The initial strong activity of the metal chimes gradually dies down to a lower plateau, when we hear the gentle pitter-patter of a very light shower, the wind then abruptly dropping further, so that only very quiet sound is heard from the metal chimes for some 8 minutes (It's about 20' in the full half-speed version of the original) \u2014 though punctuated by the bamboo chime.</b>\n\n<i>This replaced the original upload of this work, following my noticing some hiss in the main quiet section. I'm now using Bertom Denoiser Pro, which, at a modest price, gives me a lot of control over denoising my recordings. I've found that for some purposes Audacity's spectral subtraction system of noise reduction works better, but the Bertom tool is still excellent, even though no doubt there are still better (presumably AI) denoising tools, at a price.</i>\n\n<i>The changes since the original upload are all in the metal chimes layers; the bamboo layers were just fine, and I've left them untouched. I've reduced the hiss to a much lower level, and the Bertom Denoiser has also enabled me to get a really sweet-sounding reduction of the wind-in-trees sound to an optimal level, and sounding much lighter and smoother than I got with the TDR Nova dynamic EQ VST. These changes have resulted in a greater overall clarity of all the metal chimes sound \u2014 at least, to my own perception.</i>\n\n<b><i>\u2014 Except that I was increasingly bugged by the fact that I'd reduced wind sound far too much, and although, yes, this version is beautifully clear, it lacks a lot of the sense of drama and impact of the original version. Hence my uploading my FINAL version, which restores the wind sound while retaining the hiss reduction; <a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/Philip_Goddard/sounds/729050/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://freesound.org/people/Philip_Goddard/sounds/729050/</a> , to which I refer you.</i></b>\n\n<b>Chimes used:</b>\n\n(layers 1+2)\n<b>1. Music of the Spheres Gypsy Soprano</b> (6 tubes, tuned to an Eastern European Gypsy scale)\n\n<b>2. Davis Blanchard The Blues</b> (8 tubes, tuned to a laid-back sounding Blues scale)\n\n(Layers 3+4)\n<b>3. Indonesian bamboo chime, small (c. 30cm longest tube)</b> (5 tubes, imprecise tuning, but musically potent)\n\nI made the original metal chimes recording on 26 April 2018, on rough steep ground just below Hunting Gate, highest point on the Hunter's Path, Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK. Original recording not on Freesound. The bamboo chimes recording dates from 21 November 2023, on Piddledown, a little above the Hunter's Path. Geolocation is for the metal chimes.\n\n<b>Advisory</b>\nTo get the best out of this, with its mass of detail, listen with high-grade headphones.\n\n<img alt=\"Two Davis Blanchard chimes being recorded in a previous session at the same spot\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/180411_wind_chimes_hung_high_up_in_teign_gorge_for_recording.jpg\">\n<i>Two Davis Blanchard chimes being recorded in a previous session at the same spot; in this recording one of those was replaced with the Gypsy Soprano chime.</i>\n\n<img alt=\"Recording the bamboo chime\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/231211_recording-sml-bamboofancy5tube-teigng.jpg\">\n<i>Recording the bamboo chime. It did have 6 tubes, but I had to remove the smallest one after I'd accidentally trod on its tip, causing a spit, which destroyed its ability to sound a tone.</i>\n\n<b>Techie stuff:</b>\n\nRecorder for the metal chimes was a Sony PCM-D100, ill-advisedly with <i>three</i> nested custom Windcut furry windshields, on a Zipshot Mini tripod.\n\nPost-recording processing was to apply EQ in Audacity to correct for the muffling effect of the windshields. For this second, cleaner, version I used Bertom Denoiser Pro to considerably reduce the hiss and reduce wind-in-trees sound to a really nice level, and sounding much smoother into the bargain.\n\nLayer 1: half-speed, giving an octave pitch reduction; acoustic: middling foreground in cathedral;\n\nLayer 2: half-speed plus further pitch reduction to give pitch an octave plus major sixth below original; acoustic: back of cathedral.\n\nRecorder for the bamboo chime was same as for the metal chimes, but mics set at narrow angle (90\u00b0), and two nested furry windshields were used.\n\nPost-recording processing: as for metal chimes, except that A1 Stereo Control was used to widen the soundstage (135%) to provide a modest zoom-in.\n\nLayer 3: half-speed, giving an octave below original; acoustic: middling foreground in cathedral.\n\nLayer 4: speed reduction to give an octave plus a tritone below original; acoustic: ditto.\n\n<b>Please remember to give this recording a rating &#8212; Thank you!</b>&#160; <img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\">",

There is a soft breeze. This summer afternoon there are crickets, finches, larks and the green frogs. And do you hear the Eurasian Reed Warbler?? singing in the Reed.\r\nI am near a bike path where a lot of cycling is being done. That's why you sometimes hear people. In the distance the noise of the farms.\r\n\r\nYes and of course there are also aircraft flying, but they are free here. Occasionally a car or tractor over the agricultural road. \r\n\r\n<b>About the rare nature here</b>\r\nBetween the nature reserve \"de Moerputten\" and the \"Nieuwkuijks Bosje\" in the Southern part of the Netherlands, close to the city of \u2018s-Hertogenbosch in North-Brabant,  lies the old polder the \"Vlijmens Ven\". It is a \u201cNatura 2000 area\u201d, part of a European Union project called LIFE + Nature. (summery of the project ( <a href=\"https://www.natuurmonumenten.nl/project/life-project-blues-in-marshes/english-summary-blues-in-marshes\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.natuurmonumenten.nl/project/life-project-blues-in-marshes/english-summary-blues-in-marshes</a> ) Here the restored the rare blue grasslands. It is the habitat of the scarce large blue, a rare butterfly. \r\n\r\nThe butterflies whale plant is the Great Burnet. The female is preferable for low, young specimens, where she sells eggs in July and August. Once the caterpillars have come out of the egg they only eat three to four weeks of the plant, especially of the flowers. After that they let themselves fall out of the plant to be fed mainly by Myrmica ants that live in the swamp to the nest. After the caterpillar has dropped from the host plant it often takes half an hour to an hour before an ant has found him. To lure the ant, the caterpillar makes mourning noise. The ant then drinks from the honey-like substance that secretes the caterpillar for one to two hours. After that, the caterpillar takes the nest into the nest. In an ant nest is usually only room for one caterpillar. In the nest they provide the ants a honey-like substance from a special \"honey gland\" and eating the larvae and puppies of the ants. The caterpillars eat about 250 antlers. [2] Regularly, they eat the whole nest empty, but because the marshmallows often move and divide into many small nests, the nest is often recolonized. Popping will take place in June, in the mire nest, next year. In July the butterfly appears, which has two days to mate and lay eggs. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b> Area History </b>\r\nAs I said earlier, peat was used to it before. The ditch that runs here is called \"Loonse turfvaart\" (peat-ditch).\r\nIn 1397 the construction of this turf ditch began. This was completed around 1420. This ditch ran from \"Kaatsheuvel\" via the \"Bossche sloot\" to the river Dieze. The ditch served for the drainage of water from the swamp area. Lockers kept the water on level. The ditch was almost 6 meters wide and very shallow, so that only a flatbed vessel could sail. A convoy consisted of 25 ships at the end of the sixteenth century and was 400 meters long. During that time, 1500-2000 turf ships carry to the city every year. During more than 220 years, the city's peak days, turf was the main source of energy. \r\n\r\nDate/time: July 4th Tuesday 2017, start 1 pm (summer afternoon)\r\n\r\nWeather: 21, some clouds, wind SE to S 1-3 bft, 1019 hPa.

March 2024.\n<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Verdronken_zwarte_polder.jpg/800px-Verdronken_zwarte_polder.jpg\"> \n\nThis is a sound recording on the morning of March 12, 2024 in a beautiful nature reserve called 'Verdronken Zwarte Polder' near Nieuwvliet in Zeeland in the Netherlands. Here the sea flows into the area with every high tide. The salt water penetrates deep into the small area through the channels. Coastal and meadow birds come to look for food on the salt marshes, mudflats, beach plains and dunes.\n\nEarly in the year it is teeming with birds. I mainly see Black-headed Gulls and Shore/Rock Pipits??.\nIn the shipping channel you can hear the huge sea ships and in the distance an ambulance passes over land.\n\n\n<strong><b>ABOUT THIS AREA</b></strong><b>\n\nSALT AND DYNAMIC </b>\nBefore you lies a special area: the sea flows in here with every high tide and that brings life! The salt water penetrates deep into the area through the channels. Coastal and meadow birds come to the salt marshes, mudflats, beach plains and dunes to look for food, rest and breed in the spring. Thanks to the variation in the soil, more than 200 different plant species grow here.\n\n<b> FROM PEAT LANDSCAPE TO POLDER </b>\nAbout 2,600 years ago there was a vast peat landscape behind beach walls, which gradually changed into a salt marsh landscape due to rising sea levels. This created islands. In the 14th century, a deep sea channel was created around the then island of Cadzand: the Black Hole. The Zwarte Polder was constructed in 1623 to reduce the size of the sea channel.\n\n<b> FROM PEAT LANDSCAPE TO POLDER </b>\nAbout 2,000 years ago there was a vast landscape behind beach walls, which gradually changed into a salt marsh landscape in Hienfoor due to rising sea levels. In the 14th century, a deep sea channel was created around the then island of Cadzand, the Zwarte Gat. The Zwarte Polder was constructed in 1623 to reduce the sea channel.\n\n<b> \u2026AND AGAIN IN THE WAVES </b>\nDuring the storm surge of 1802, the dike of the Zwarte Polder broke and the polder disappeared into the sea again. The western part has been diked again: the \u2018Herdijkte Zwarte Polder\u2019. The dike remains overflowed and became dunes, and the sea turned it into a dynamic area with salt marshes and mudflats. One of the few small open tidal inlets in an otherwise almost closed coast of the Netherlands and Belgium.\n\n<b> BEACH NATURE </b>\nThe soil has a wide variation: from sand to clay, and from salty seawater to fresh rainwater. That is why more than 200 different wild plant species grow here. Shorebirds such as ringed plover and oystercatcher breed on the breeding bird beach on the west side in the spring. Birds such as nightingales and warblers breed in the shrubs on the dunes.\nCoastal breeding birds breed on the beach on the bare ground.\n\n<a href=\"https://freesound.org/search/?q=240312+klankbeeld&amp;f=duration%3A%5B0+TO+*%5D&amp;w=&amp;tm=0&amp;s=Automatic+by+relevance&amp;advanced=1&amp;g=&amp;only_p=&amp;cm=0&amp;mm=0\" rel=\"nofollow\">More here today</a> / <a href=\"https://freesound.org/search/?q=Verdronken+zwarte+polder+klankbeeld&amp;f=duration%3A%5B0+TO+*%5D&amp;w=&amp;tm=0&amp;s=Automatic+by+relevance&amp;advanced=1&amp;g=&amp;only_p=&amp;cm=0&amp;mm=0\" rel=\"nofollow\">More here trough the years</a>\n\nDate/time: March 12 Tuesday 2024, start 9:49 AM\n\nWeather: 9c,clouded, wind SW 10-24 km/h, 1014 hPa, humidity 94%, visibility 10km, dew point 6c.\n\nLocation; Verdronken Zwarte Polder, coast North Sea / Westeschelde, Nieuwvliet / Cadzand, Zeeland, Netherlands (Holland), Europe geo 51.38660 3.43607\n\nGear chain: Sennheiser mkh30/50 MS, in Rycote cyclone small, windjammer; Sound Devices 302;Tascam dr-100 Mk2.

        "description": "Outdoor walk between modern buildings of a business centre (binaural, please use headset for 3D effects). \nI made this recording while walking in a pedestrian area between modern buildings of a big business centre called La D\u00e9fense, located in the west suburbs of Paris (France). \nOne can hear people walking, chatting while going to work, sometimes pulling luggage... In the background, some birds and noises from a nearby construction site. One can also hear light rain on my jacket and wind from time to time, as the weather wasn\u2019t so nice on that day...\nRecorded in October 2022 with an Olympus LS-P4 and Ohrwurm 3D binaural microphones. \nFade in/out and high pass filter at 60Hz -6dB/oct applied in Audacity. \n(If you want to use this sound as a mono audio file, you may have to delete one channel to avoid phase issues).",
