        "description": "<b>This is peaceful despite the thunder, which is all leisurely and non-threatening. The rain sound itself is subdued from this viewpoint, and accompanied by much trickling sound from run-off water in drainpipes \u2014 a very pleasantly watery soundscape.</b>\n\nWhen I got up on Saturday 28 September 2013 with daylight hardly showing yet, I was aware of some quite heavy rain, but not at all expecting thunder. With the double-glazed windows closed I thought I was also hearing the refuse collectors banging around a bit as I went to get breakfast. Then I saw a flash and got my brain into gear &#8212; not refuse collectors at all: wrong day! Hurried set-up of recorder on bedroom window sill!\n\nThank goodness, although it was early morning there was surprisingly little pronounced traffic noise as I'd expect normally at that time (this is in city centre) &#8212; no doubt because it was a Saturday, and maybe the rain was discouraging some people from setting out so early. So I had surprisingly little to cut out of the recording because of disturbances.\n\nLocation of recording: Exeter city centre, Devon, UK.\n\n<b>Advisory</b>\n\nDespite this being a peaceful soundscape the dynamic range is still pretty large. For a realistic rendition a volume setting of <b>9dB higher</b> than a sensible normal level is necessary. Also, high-grade headphones would generally get the best listening results.\n\n<img alt=\"Setup for this recording (Ouch!)&#8230;\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/130928_bedroom-windowsill-old-recording-setup.jpg\">\n<i>As no sufficiently relevant photo was available, I just took this afternoon shot on 12 July 2023 to show my hilariously precarious setup for all my bedroom window recordings up to my disastrous one on the night of 26-27 May 2017, about more of which just see below&#8230;\n&#8212; Dash! Just noticed. I thought the recorder should be a little more forward, and I now see why. The tripod should be the other way round, with one leg at the rear and the other two at the front!</i>\n\n<b>Techie stuff:</b>\n\nThe recorder was a Sony PCM-M10, with R&#248;de DeadKitten furry windshield (original, superior, light-grey version). It was ill-advisedly (read 'stupidly'!)* placed on a Hama Mini tripod, which is very mini, on my bedroom window sill, raised sufficiently by a stack of books, and with the thick curtain pulled across behind it to minimize sounds from within my flat (and doors also kept closed).\n\n*I say 'ill-advisedly' because in certain circumstances the recorder could easily get pushed or knocked out of the (second-floor) window, with paving stones to fall on below. This did happen with my first PCM D100 in 2017, which taught me not to take chances about that in the future. &#8212; And then I remembered a much chunkier Velbon 'mini' tripod that was languishing in a drawer, and used that with no leg extension and maximum column extension, which took the recorder to just the right height with the legs still fitting on the ledge, the recorder a little further forward, and not a book in sight. That setup was impossible to get pushed out of the window, so since then it's been my standard arrangement for bedroom window recordings.\n\nAs to the fate of that D100 recorder that did hit the paving stone &#8212; that model is, figuratively, built like a tank, and although the (metal) casing was a bit buckled, and it was a little fiddly operating control buttons because the casing was raised a little on top, with some edge gaps, to this day it still works flawlessly. I just regard it as a backup 'extra', and also always use it for bedroom window recordings &#8212; of course with small polythene bag around its body to minimize ingress of dust, water and prying little beasties. So, yes, you could say I have a fond 'special relationship' with that recorder, which is my elite bedroom-window thunderstorm one.\n\nPost-recording processing was EQ in Audacity to correct for muffling caused by the furry windshield, and to correct for a quite strong 'alcove resonance' in the low bass, which any recorder picks up there. Subsequent processing was in A1 Stereo Control VST plugin to widen and sharpen the stereo image (160%).\n\n<b>Please remember to give this recording a rating &#8212; Thank you! <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\"></b>",

        "description": "Most horizontal, high altitude, calm thunderstorm coming and going in calm suburban residence during late evening/Night. Sometimes a car passing, a dog baking and sometime a human voice. Most of the time just the rain in he gutter on plants, trees, on the street and on he cars and the far and sometimes close thunder. There is a great variation in rain, wind and thunder sound-level.\r\n\r\nMy metaphor on this recording is getting older, disability, death represented by thunder, wind and rain and the daily life that continues far away in the background represented by the other sounds in the background. \r\nLife is meaningless , so enjoy it!\r\n\r\nUseful as background in film, movie, game and radio-play etc. Pick out your part!\r\nOr.... Fall asleep on this recording?  \r\nSwami klankbeeld ;-) Haha\r\n\r\nRemarks:\r\n00.20 dog barking\r\n02.16 dog barking\r\n02.35 man shouting something shortly\r\n03.10 dog barking\r\n03.27 bike\r\n06.45 car\r\n07.37 car\r\n08.50 car coming and shut down smashing doors\r\n09.55 car\r\n13.05 closing garage door\r\n14.26 car horn\r\n17.07 closing aluminium indoor shutters\r\n35.15-78.30 high altitude thunder and strong winds and heavy rains, all coming in large waves\r\n51.20 car\r\n55.14 car horn\r\n78.30-end; last rain and thunder and gutter-noise to the end of recording.\r\n\r\n<b>WARNING!</b> Play on low level, because the levels variate between -48 and 0 dB.\r\n\r\nRecorded; starting July 27th 2013 11 pm, out of second floor window in calm suburban environment in the Netherlands. Using two Primo EM172 omni microphones in AB45 setting in a DIY blimp > Sony PCM D50. \r\nSound-correction for blimps with Audacity (from1-16kHz from 0 to +9dB log, >16kHz +9dB). \r\n\r\nThis is a modern high quality -q10 (1500kbps) OGG Vobis compression file (48000Hz/16bit). The quality is almost as good  as the 48/24-WAV original file. You can easily use this file in HD-film and HIFI music-tracks. The sound-quality is, after this compression technique still very high The file size reduction is about 75% of the 2304kbps WAV-track\r\n\r\nWhen you use this sound it would be nice if you spent a voluntarily donation to freesound.  \r\nYOU ALWAYS HAVE TO CREDIT/ATTRIBUTE me (klankbeeld) and freesound.org in your work if you use this sound.

        "description": "Some of the results of new experiments to create artificial thunder rolls and claps. A lot of work has been done. I think that I managed to come close to liveliness and naturalness, as well as add a little sharpness and pressure. When creating these sounds, sounds not related to a thunderstorm were used and the sounds and elements of live thunder rolls or thunderclaps were not used. All sources and intermediate experiments were taken only from my own library. The sounds were subjected to various complex manipulations and processing.\n\nHere's another thunder sound design from the same session:\n<a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/sounds/696391/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/sounds/696391/</a>\n\nOlder experiments can be found here: \n<a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/sounds/587761/edit/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/sounds/587761/edit/</a>\n\nHere the thunder rolls from earlier experiments is mixed with rain:\n<a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/sounds/659591/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/sounds/659591/</a>",

        "description": "I wasn't happy with my first recording of thunder in Johor Bahru because it was missing most of the high- and mid-frequency content, and so most of the detail and movement. I really wanted to capture the terrific crack of the thunder as well as the effect of thunder rolling around the hills. \n\nAs I didn't have a better mic on hand, I made a new recording using the back-up function of my portable recorder. This function will make two recordings simultaneously, one 10dB lower than the other. I used the softer recording as the base, and then layered on the louder recording twice. The first time I used a filter to remove any frequencies below 4570 Hz. This gave me the crack of the thunder and the sense of air and movement. The second layer removed frequencies below 300 Hz, which meant that you can hear the rain. The result is much closer to the sounds that I could hear. \n\nThis recording was made mid-afternoon in October of 2022. If you want just the unedited version of the softer recording you can find that on my page as well.",

        "description": "In the small hours of 28th June 2012 it was raining a bit here in central Exeter, UK (which very rarely has thunderstorms), and I heard an occasional very distant boom of thunder. Just in case the storm was going to develop more and come over, I set up my Sony PCM-M10 raised up on a window ledge in my bedroom and set it going at 02.50, getting back into bed and leaving it to to capture whatever it would.\n\nI'd set the recording level very low in order not to have any close lightning strikes clipped, but I needn't have worried about that because all I got was a recording of the gentle rain (only just audible) plus the more noticeable trickling of rainwater off my roof, with the occasional sound of seagulls and an almost constant deep muttering and mumbling of thunder at or just beyond the limit of audibility (you need speakers / headphones with extended low bass response to hear much of it), and with the very occasional more distinctly audible but still very quiet booms of thunder. Because of the low recording level, my normalizing the file to a genuinely representative level has meant a very considerable amplification, and I was thus really surprised how well it came out. \n\nAs the thunder was receding and the rain / trickling sounds gradually reducing while the recorder was running, after some half-hour I terminated the recording (enviously seeing extremely frequent lightning flashing far away to the south-east, meaning the storm was entertaining people somewhere else and not coming my way at all), and subsequently I cut off the last bit of the recording to improve the overall effect.\n\nActually that storm system remained virulently active through the day, causing widespread havoc especially in the Midlands and northern England, with flash floods, local large hail and the odd tornado. What I had missed! :-(\n\nSo, this recording is a non-event as a thunderstorm recording but is still a nice bit of quiet 'atmosphere'. The seagulls are mostly Herring Gull, but with some Lesser Black-backed Gull. The latter have a similar range of sounds to the Herring Gull, but with distinctively reedy or hoarse-sounding voice.\n\nPlease note that the volume level of this recording has been carefully adjusted for listening purposes, and ALL my recordings so far are meant to be listened to with a volume setting that would give a realistic level for playback of CLASSICAL music (a large but not exceptional symphony orchestra). If you have the right volume setting, you should not need to change that setting from one recording of mine to another.\n<p><b>Please remember to give this recording a rating! <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\"></b></p>",

        "description": "This stereo recording was made on November 23, 2014 in Grays Harbor Washington during a rare thunderstorm. The clip contains rain falling on a wooden deck and recurring peals of thunder both near and far.\r\n\r\nThis original recording was made using a ZOOM H-6 Handy Recorder with ZOOM stereo XY microphone. The track was edited in Audacity 2.0.6 to remove a few artifacts. Total run time for this WAV file is: 8:29.\r\n\r\nThis is my first upload. I am hearing impaired and new to field audio recording. I am fascinated by this art form and hearing sounds that I haven\u2019t been able to hear in twenty years. I would greatly appreciate your feedback on the quality of my work and, if you choose to use this in a project, the end use you have in mind.\r\n",

Since this was a longer uninterrupted recording it may have captured my dorm mates going up the stairs, eventual cars. It was recorded at 3:00am so the unwanted noises are minimal.\nSome thunders have REALLY LOUD LOWS so be careful.\nEnjoy!",

Recorded in the middle of the country by placing a mic outside the man cave window of my house. The storm starts with light rain and some medium distance thunder. At about 4:00 mins the wind starts to pick up and by 5 mins the wind sound drowns out everything else (50-60 mph gusts). By 6:00 mins the wind is fading as the storm front passes. By 9:00 mins it\u2019s just soft rain and occasional thunder.  At about 13:00 mins, the thunder starts picking up a bit. At about 17:00 mins it starts raining harder again, with occasional thunder, until the end. A couple of human noises were edited out, and noise reduction was applied.",

Recorded on a Zoom H5.\n\nThere are also some household sounds swimming around in the background, doors closing, dishes clinking etc;  I think you can hear the radio or something very faintly towards the end -- but there's plenty of clean usable thunder and rain in there.\n\nIncidentally I often use this type of thing in my long-form instrumental music, produced under the name conelrad. I have a podcast of album-length instrumental music which comes out every other week, called conelcast. Check it out wherever you get podcasts or at <a href=\"http://conelrad.co.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\">conelrad.co.uk</a> if that kinda thing interests you.",

The changing sound was achieved by staring with a low noise sound and adjusting its pitch and level while also increasing the amount of resonance to add the musical element. These changes were then slowly reversed.There is also an underlying rhythm from a slow lfo.

This is not one straight-through take, but actually small segments of different storms edited together. I edited the recordings in Kristal Audio Engine, filling all 16 channels with different layers of sound and designing the short clip to have a defined beginning, middle, and end ( the end is signaled when the loud rain gives way to the simple splash of water shooting down from a gutter). These recordings were mostly made with my handheld Tascam DR 07, a few takes of rain were also made with a Crown SASS Stereo Mic. ",

Then suddenly comes the heavy rain and some more thunder. I think this actually is a spooky recording, because the farmers machines gives a very special dark sound. After i recorded this, it got too windy to continue recording.\n\nThis was recorded with a TSM PR1  portable digital recorder, with external stereo microphones.

        "description": "<b>Peaceful rain, yes, but always with a little bit of menace. Improved version of one of my first uploads here.</b>\n\nIn the small hours of 28th June 2012 it was raining a bit here in central Exeter, UK (which very rarely has thunderstorms), and I heard an occasional very distant boom of thunder. Just in case the storm was going to develop more and come over, I set up my Sony PCM-M10 raised up on a window ledge in my bedroom and set it going at 02.50, getting back into bed and leaving it to to capture whatever it would.\n\nI'd set the recording level very low in order not to have any close lightning strikes clipped, but I needn't have worried about that because all I got was a recording of the gentle rain (only just audible) plus the more noticeable trickling of rainwater off my roof, with the occasional sound of seagulls and an almost constant deep muttering and mumbling of thunder at or just beyond the limit of audibility (you need speakers / headphones with extended low bass response to hear much of it), and with the very occasional more distinctly audible but still very quiet booms of thunder. Because of the low recording level, my normalizing the file to a genuinely representative level has meant a very considerable amplification, and I was thus really surprised how well it came out. \n\nAs the thunder was receding and the rain / trickling sounds gradually reducing while the recorder was running, after some half-hour I terminated the recording (enviously seeing the sky lit up far away to the south-east by almost continuous lightning, meaning the storm was entertaining people somewhere else and not coming my way at all), and subsequently I cut off the last bit of the recording to improve the overall effect.\n\nActually that storm system remained virulently active through the day, causing widespread havoc especially in the Midlands and northern England, with flash floods, local large hail and the odd tornado. What I'd missed! :-(\n\nSo, this recording is a non-event as a thunderstorm recording but is still a nice bit of quiet 'atmosphere'. The seagulls are mostly Herring Gull, but with some Lesser Black-backed Gull. The latter have a similar range of sounds to the Herring Gull, but with distinctively reedy or hoarse-sounding voice.\n\n\n<b>Techie stuff:</b>\n\nThe recorder was Sony PCM-M10, with Rycote Mini Windjammer furry windshield. It was set up on a Hama Mini tripod, which I regard as not just 'mini' but tiny, and so had to be raised up on a pile of books to be at the right height (NOT a good arrangement, as I learnt the hard way later on!).\n\nPost-recording processing was to apply EQ in Audacity to correct for the muffling effect of the windshield &#8212; and to correct for a lower bass resonance caused by the shallow window alcove, and then more recently stereo widening / sharpening-up using the VST plugin A1 Stereo Control (160% widening).\n\n<b>Please remember to give this recording a rating &#8212; Thank you!</b>&#160; <img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\">",

I've heard more violent thunderstorms in Texas, but I haven't had my recording equipment ready.  These recordings came off my first professional piece of recording equipment - the Tascasm portastudio.  Nice unit.  Battery powered and really flexible.  The only weird part was the dbx sound reduction.  I don't think I used it on this recording - and that's why it's a bit hissy - still, the thunder was incredible.  Most of these thunder claps rolled through before the rain.  \"Thunderstorm-1989-e is a recording of when the rain starts - and more violent thunder follows.  Enjoy.\n\n:30 - Recorded July 1988 - Danbury CT - EV635 to Tascam Portastudio.",

Although each storm was recorded in a slightly different location, everything is from the greater Detroit, MI, USA area.\r\n-Recorded entirely with a Tascam DR-03 set at 48 K / 24 bit. Then each different storm was edited together in Magix Music Maker.\r\n-This Album version fades out with a simple, repeating synth line.",

        "description": "Once again, the opportunity to visit an abandoned building turned up. Now I wasn't there purposefully, but I was just nearby when the storm started. And I took cover there so as not to get wet. And of course, the recorder is always with me. Recorded at the entrance to the abondoned building. Raindrops and water from the roof eaves fall on piles of debris, scattered pieces of furniture, glass and building materials. Infrequent rumbles of thunder are heard. \nRecorded June 06 , 2024 on Tascam DR-05x, with post processing.\nLocation: near the city of Ekaterinburg (Russia)\n<img src=\"https://i.postimg.cc/ZYV7nL50/20240606-153340.jpg\">\n<img src=\"https://i.postimg.cc/MKHsQjn5/20240606-153424.jpg\">\nI ask you, if possible, to help this wonderful site (not me) stay afloat and develop further.

The heavy rain was followed by thunder, then transforms into softer rain that lets you hear faint city sounds like cars, doors closing, someone using a screwdriver, voices, the bells of a nearby church, airplanes and birds. There's so much to hear, I couldn't stop recording. I only took out some little peaks caused by the movement of my ear.",

My flat where I recorded from was on 4th floor. There was a busy street 50m far from the apartment building itself, a bit further there was a park.\n\nRain at that night was heavy. Also you can hear several heavy thunder hits of various distance throughout the whole recording.\n\nHope this recording will help to enhance the sound of your next project.

The recording is unedited.\r\n\r\nAt 1:35 I move the mics closer to the deck so you can hear the splashing. At about At 3:10 I you\u2019ll hear a different timbre as I move away from the rain and under an awning. About 3:45 the rain settles down and the birds start chirping again. Hopefully there are some useful segments in here.\r\n\r\nRecorded with a dead cat on a TASCAM DR-05 at 48Khz 24 bit, then compressed with \u201clame --preset insane --scale 10\u201d to make up for the low gain I used (I was afraid a thunderclap would engage the limiter).\r\n\r\nCheers.",

        "description": "Another recording of rain and thunder, but in some ways a better one.  This one is a surprisingly big crack and rumble preceded and followed by a nice sounding rain.  I made this by positioning a stereo-matched pair of AKG C451B condenser mics in an exaggerated X-Y configuration (a wider stereo field) and aiming them out of my open window.  The mics went into a Universal Audio 2-610 preamp, an Apogee Duet 2, and then Ableton at 48kHz and 24 bits.  I believe I had the mics set flat, and there was no post processing (though I was mightily tempted to upload the much-better-sounding EQed and compressed files) so that you can fine tune it to suit your needs.  You'll notice that the loudest parts of the thunder boom clipped the input, but, due to the pleasant and forgiving nature of vacuum tubes, the clipping sounds more compressed than distorted.  Feel free to use this sound in any commercial or artistic work!  You do not need to credit me. ",

        "description": "Rain, with the occasional deep rumble of thunder, falls on many surfaces. There's a higher pitched harsh pinging roar from outside the building, the soft rush of rain on the tree overhanging the hole in the roof, and the slower, random dripping sound of raindrops hitting the pooled water on the concrete floor. The rainfall noise from inside the building echos and reverberates within the building, while the outside rain (and thunder) doesn't echo. \n\nRecorded on August 13, 2021, during an afternoon sudden rainstorm in Taipei, Taiwan, Xinyi District. The location is in a dense neighborhood of 5 story multi family units, many of which have tin sidings and awnings. Two small units are bombed-out looking collapsed concrete structures, with the kitchens still intact, which towards the end of the recording can be heard emitting the sound of drips hitting their porcelain sinks. Overhanging the building's collapsed roof (partially concrete and wood) is an old growth tree. It's a very beautiful location and I'm very pleased with the soundscape it offers during a rainstorm. \n\nRecorded on a Zoom h1n stuffed inside a homemade windbreaker, set on a broken concrete windowsill and sheltered from the rain by a concrete awning. Recorded in the h1n's 96k 24bit setting, locut off, limiter on, autolevel off, at microphone level 8.",

I took my Zoom H1n and left it on in a large wooden screened in front porch and went back to bed for about an hour and half. The Mother Lodge is a rustic cabin in Le Roy, MI. It's about half a mile from US-131, so about 15 minutes in you can hear the faint sound of semi trucks starting to make their morning commutes along rural west Michigan.\n\nThe passing thunder tapers off into a rainstorm for most of the track and you'll hear the dawn bird chorus. About 17 minutes in you start hearing a strange angelic type music (at least that's what it sounds like in my headphones), still not sure what this sound is, my best guess is that it's produced reverberating sound of semis on US-131 coming through the forest. It seems to start up around the same time as their morning commute.",

There is some rain noise on a tin roof throughout the recording.\n\nThis sound has a few problems. It was just too cool of a sound to throw away, so I fixed it up as best I could.\nSomeone near me screamed during the first second of the thunder. I tried to reduce the scream as much as possible without decreasing the sound quality, but it can still be heard if you listen closely.\nThere was also a bit of clipping, but I fixed that with Audacity's repair tool.\n\nRecorded 17/09/2019 with a H4n Pro onboard stereo mics\nEdited in Audacity 21/01/2021 and 16/06/2021",

The building contained offices, lounges and dining rooms, and underground warehouses. All windows and doors in the building are smashed and broken. The interior is in complete disarray and ruin. Recorded inside the building, in one of the offices. You can hear the sounds of rain and falling drops coming from outside, leaks and drops from the ceilings of the room, infrequent rolls of thunder.\nRecorded on Tascam DR-05x, near from Ekaterinburg (Russia)\n<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/4818cWP/20211008-130832.jpg\">\n<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/tK4jbF6/20211008-124942.jpg\">",

So, a thunder storm rolls in and you grab all your recording gear and rush out to stand under your verandah and realise the rain on the tin roof is too noisy...so you go stand in your garage with the door up (not happy with the rain on the paving which is a bit loud but what can you do)...and wait and wait...and just as the perfect thunder clap happens all the dogs in the neighbourhood start barking, or a car goes past...so you give up and just before the garage door closes you see a huge flash so you quickly stop the door closing and stick the microphone through the 10 cm gap at the bottom\u2026this is what you get. Not great but it's clean and interesting. Recording chain: Rode NT4 (stereo microphone in Cini-City Blimp) \u2013 Sound Devices MixPre (Mic preamp) \u2013 Edirol R-09 (digital recorder 44.1 kHz @ 16 bit). ",

Too bad it has other noises in it.\r\n\r\nMade with hand held Zoom H2, internal rear stereo mics used.

        "description": "<b>An afternoon thundery shower, with longish anticipatory lead-in with increasing gusts of wind in the trees before rain and thunder come in. All the thunder is rather to very distant, apart from one very loud and moderately startling (presumably) ground strike (probably two or three in rapid succession).</b>\n\n<b>Thunderstorms are quite a rarity in Exeter, so for me each storm is a very special event.</b>\n\nThis thundery shower developed and largely just passed by during early afternoon, 11 June 2020, and I was doubtful how worthwhile it would be recording at this time, with all the city noise. The small hours is the time to get decent thunderstorm recordings from my abode. However, frustrated with all the covid restrictions, I set the recorder up anyway as soon as I saw suspicious-looking cloud developments, just in case. In the event there was a <i>lot</i> of disturbance, including yacking neighbours, but at least the rain chased them off somewhat.\n\nUsually my edits are carefully done and are undetectable, but there's one significant edit that does attract attention to itself this time. That is just after the rain has started, just at moderate intensity to start with. The observant listener would notice that when the rain rapidly becomes quite heavy, the trickling and gurgling of run-off from all the neighbourhood's roofs increases simultaneously. To avoid that giveaway, I'd have had to cut out a whole lot more, so I just had to keep it like that. Also, I'm not altogether keen on my immediate neighbour's budgies getting in on the act so prominently, but if I were going to cut <i>them</i> out I'd have little recording left!\n\n<b>Advisory:</b>\nTo hear this to best effect you need high-grade headphones, and to have the volume setting about <b>9dB above</b> a sensible normal level for a realistic rendition of symphonic orchestral music. That's a trebling of the sound level.\n\n<b>Techie stuff:</b>\nThe recorder was a Sony PCM-D100, with two nested Windcut furry windshields (custom design), and it was placed on a Velbon Mini tripod with full extension of centre column on my bedroom window sill, with the window as wide open as it would go.\n\nInitial post-recording processing was to apply an EQ curve to compensate for muffling from the furry windshields, and to compensate for 'alcove resonance' in the bass. I used Audacity ('clip fix' function) to repair the clipped peaks of the one loud bit, but in this case the repair didn't work properly, and various peaks in that little angry outburst remain in a clipped state.\n\n<b>Please remember to give this recording a rating &#8212; Thank you!</b>&#160; <img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\">",

        "description": "<b>Warning &#8212; big dynamic range!</b>\n\n<b>A gradual approach of this May thunderstorm in Exeter, UK city centre, culminating in an apocalyptic-sounding ground strike, and then&#8230; nothing much! The rainfall that came over sounded only moderately heavy, though with a scattering of hailstones for a short while.</b>\n\nFor a few days the UK Met Office had been showing a quite good thunderstorm likelihood for Exeter from mid-morning to mid-afternoon on 9 May 2023, but then on the day the indications changed to just some mostly light showers &#8212; the thunderstorms now being expected elsewhere. So I didn't bother after all to set up my recorder on my bedroom window ledge &#8212; until, by late morning the thickening clouds were now beginning to look dark and thundery, and I was wondering\u2026 I set up the recorder just in case, but then realized that the breeze was enough to blow rain in over the recorder (as indeed forecast), and in the right direction to do so. So I took it down and closed the window, and got on with some work.\n\nThen I heard the odd semi-distant rumble of thunder from a system that was passing-by rather than coming over. I returned the recorder to the bedroom window sill just in case, but that system was already moving away, and the recorder captured nothing worthwhile. But the Rain Alarm app on my phone showed another chunk of heavy to torrential shower coming up close behind, and Lightning Tracker, also on my phone, showed some strikes in that area. It looked as though the wind had dropped, too, so I left the recorder running, and captured about 56' of that particular storm.\n\nMost of it wasn't overhead. It came in from WSW, and as so often happens when a storm does occur here, one arm of it was passing by to the SE, and the other arm passing by on the NE side, with mostly less intense precipitation and darkness here than on either side. A good proportion of the lightnings, even when distant, could be recognised as at least containing ground strikes, because of their sudden heavily explosive sounds. And as usually happens when a thunderstorm does get as close as it's going to, the lightning frequency dropped. Thus when it had got loud to a certain point there were only few further flashes, with big gaps.\n\nAfter the first of those big gaps we get the two strongest strikes of all &#8212; the second of those being truly apocalyptic in sound if listened to at the indicated volume setting (see further below). There was a further strike with a rather similar sound to that biggest one, but it was one of the many casualties of city noises, and I had to cut it out. &#8212; And after that, just rain, and with a lot of city noise, so I cut all that out too. The original 56' of the recording got reduced to 29' in the process.\n\n<b>Advisory</b> \n\nBecause of the big dynamic range, in order to hear most of the sound even at all, <strong>you need to listen at a volume setting of some 24 (yes, twenty-four) dB above</strong> a normal sensible setting. <strong>High-grade headphones strongly recommended!</strong>\n\n<img alt=\"An earlier photo of a thunderstom developing as it approaches, from my bedroom window\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/230509-190811_developing_thunderstorm_approaching_exeter_city_centre.jpg\"><i>An earlier thunderstorm (11 August 2019) developing as it approaches, seen from my living room window, with almost the same view as where this new recording was made.</i>\n\n<b>Techie stuff:</b>\nThe recorder was a Sony PCM-D100, with two nested Windcut custom furry windshields, and set up on a Velbon Mini tripod.\n\nPost-recording processing was to apply EQ in Audacity to correct for the muffling effect of the windshields, plus correction for a low bass resonance in the particular window recess.\n\n<b>Please remember to give this recording a rating &#8212; Thank you!</b>&#160; <img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\">",

        "description": "<b>A night sequence of heavy to torrential showers, including a brief thunderstorm, the latter being still more torrential (real pandemonium!).</b>\n\n<b>Thunderstorms are quite a rarity in Exeter, so for me each storm is a very special event.</b>\n\nI made this recording through the night of 18&#8211;19 October 2022.\n\nThe events are presented in original order, with uneventful interludes each reduced to a useful short length, and all the more intrusive city sounds cut out, though with some flexibility in order to retain as much as possible of the soundscape that I did want. Relatively gentle gusts of wind become apparent during interludes, blowing through the trees as they chase around among the houses.\n\nThe sequence is as follows:\n\n<b>1. Very heavy shower.</b>\n\n<b>2. Brief torrential shower.</b>\n\n<b>3. Relatively short (fast-moving) thunderstorm, still more torrential, from first grumbling murmur that I could pick out. None of the lightning was overhead; the centre of the line of storm (moving S. to N., along its axis) passing-by a bit west of here. Presumably for that reason, the thunder gives us no big dramatics; the latter may well still have been happening, but a bit further west.</b>\n\n<b>4. Two brief torrential showers, apparently with a scattering of hailstones</b>\n\n<b>5. Thundery shower, not so torrential.</b>\n\nThat final thundery shower has more background traffic noise, as by then it's late in the small hours, and some bleary-eyed motorists are already going to work.\n\nFor those wanting the thunderstorm in a smaller download, my next upload here is just that &#8212; though I myself find that particular storm most effective when heard in context, as part of the whole sequence.\n\n<b>Advisory:</b>\nTo hear this to best effect you need high-grade headphones, and to have the volume setting about <strong>6dB above</strong> a sensible normal level for a realistic rendition of symphonic orchestral music. That's a doubling of the sound level.\n\n<img alt=\"Thundery shower clouds &#8212; looking south-west from my abode\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/221101__02_thundery_shower_clouds_sw_from_exeter_centre.jpg\">\n<i>Late afternoon thundery shower clouds with spread-out anvil tops, photographed on 1 November 2022; looking SW from my living room &#8212; almost the same view as from my bedroom, where the recorder was.</i>\n\n<b>Techie stuff:</b>\nThe recorder was a Sony PCM-D100, with two nested Windcut furry windshields (custom design), and it was placed on a Velbon Mini tripod with full centre column extension on my bedroom window sill, with the window as wide open as it would go.\n\nInitial post-recording processing was to apply an EQ curve to compensate for muffling from the furry windshields, and to compensate for 'alcove resonance' in the bass.\n\n<b>Please remember to give this recording a rating &#8212; Thank you!</b>&#160; <img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\">",

        "description": "<b>A full thunderstorm, with some earth strikes, though not coming frighteningly close, with robins singing at times. This is a pretty active storm, with a long approach period &#8212; about 25 minutes before starting to sound at all close, but then the lightning activity rapidly slackens off, though still with the odd now more distant rumbles. Noticeable rain doesn't come on till the relatively close lightnings have passed.</b>\n\n<b>Thunderstorms are quite a rarity in Exeter, so for me each such storm is a very special event.</b>\n\nThis recording was made on very early morning of 19 September 2014, from my bedroom window in city centre, Exeter, Devon, UK.\n\nFor some reason I'd neglected to set up the recorder at bedtime as I normally would when thunderstorms in the area were at all likely, so, about 4.45 a.m. I awoke to the sound of what I took at first to be a very distant high-altitude jet aeroplane, and then suddenly realized what it was, and duly expleted, amusedly cross with myself for not having the recorder already running, then hurriedly set it up. My saving grace this time was the very long approach time of this storm, so if I hadn't said anything about the matter it would seem that I'd captured the storm pretty well from its very first audible murmurs.\n\n<b>Advisory:</b>\nTo hear this to best effect you need high-grade headphones, and to have the volume setting about <b>9dB above</b> a sensible normal level for a realistic rendition of symphonic orchestral music. To clarify, you need the volume set so that, in the opening, the background sound, with almost inaudible thunder murmurs, is clearly, but only just, audible &#8212; hoping that makes sense!\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\">\n\n<img alt=\"Thundery sky at sunrise time, from my bedroom window\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/131020_thundery_sunrise_sky,_central_exeter_06.jpg\">\n<i>Thundery sky at sunrise time, on 10 October 2013, as part of the view from my bedroom window, from where I made this recording</i>\n\n<b>Techie stuff:</b>\nThe recorder was a Sony PCM-M10, with R&#248;de DeadKitten furry windshield (original, more effective version), and it was placed on a Hama Mini tripod (very small) raised up on some books <em>(BAD idea, as I was later to find out the hard way!!)</em> on my bedroom window sill, with the window as wide open as it would go.\n\nInitial post-recording processing was to apply an EQ curve to compensate for muffling from the furry windshield, and to compensate for 'alcove resonance' in the bass, and much more recently it's had stereo widening / sharpening processing to 200% width with <i><b>A1 Stereo Control</b></i> VST plugin, then a 7dB EQ tilt away from the treble (straight line from no change at 100Hz to -7dB at 8K) to compensate for the treble overemphasis caused by the stereo widening.\n\n<b>Please remember to give this recording a rating &#8212; Thank you!</b> <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\">",

I hit record slightly too late to catch the first couple of bell rings, but got most of it.  First we hear the church signal 8pm, then we hear the courthouse do the same thing.  Also some wind in the trees right above the mic, some rain, a bit of thunder, and some cars in a small town.   Also a huge truck with loud engine that sounds almost like thunder towards the end, in fact it was mixed with thunder at one moment.  Captured with maudio delta1010LT soundcard. ",

Blended all tracks to get this recording.  Kind of a primitive 360\u00b0 surround thing to see what it would turn out like.  Front and rear mics were both set at 120\u00b0, so not exactly in correct phase, but it's doable.  The crawlspace in the attic was approx. 4 feet high, and all mic's were roughly 8 inches beneath the plywood roof, trusses and shingles.  Faint sounds of water splashing came through the eaves and were a result of water running off the roof and splashing into flowerbeds and onto driveway.  Probably should have blocked the eaves while recording, but this was just an initial experiment to see what I would change for next recording in the attic.",

The resulting sound was thereafter judiciously processed using the Sir Elliot 18 band VST graphic equalizer to produce a somewhat less strident tonality that is more in keeping with the sound of a genuine rainfall.  Particular attention was paid to the enhancement of the distant thunder in the original track.  The signal was thereafter further enhanced using a Freeverb 3 Stereo Enhancer.  The end result of all this tinkering is a lush and realistic (to my ears) stereo sonic experience.  \r\n\r\nVolume normalized such that a -3 db peak was not exceeded.  Manually trimmed to loop rather unobtrusively.  WAV format, 16 bit stereo, 48000 Hz.\r\n",

There was a thunder going on, so I waited for that to fade before moving so I did not spoil the recording.\r\nAt some point I am also taking photos with my camera. You can hear the servo of the auto-focus, the beeps it makes and the actual camera shutter. Because there was enough delay between the lightnings which I was photographing and the thunder , my photographic activities should not have spoiled the recording of the thunder sounds...",

I opened the balcony door and rolled down the 30 years old window blind ( I have a sound of this blind here on the channel) Behind the window blind I started recording how the rain hammered against the blind! You can also listen to the wind between the units on this blind! I also recorded with the Go Pro the outside so that you can see the thunder, the rain and the lightning!",

My Tascam recorder was set up outside in a covered patio area, able to pick up the quickly increasing rain, while the extraordinarily loud cracks of lightning and booming thunder kept constant.",

Hail comes in and pounds a deck outside for about a minute or so, then fades and raindrops themselves take prominence. The wind picks up, so you can hear wind chimes going at it and some deep rolling thunder far in the background. If you\u2019ve experienced high winds before, it will probably sound scary to you at volume.\r\n\r\nRecorded with a TASCAM DR-05 with a dead cat and no low cut. I got the mics as close to an open window as I could without being ridiculous. Cropped and faded in and out in audacity. No other modifications, so you\u2019ll have to normalize it and equalize to your liking. \r\n\r\nMight be useful as a \u201cheavy rain\u201d sound, since the hail kind of sounds like that anyway.",

This sample is just a cut. At the end there is some noise because i had to pull the microphones into the door because of the rain. At one time, there was a thunder with such dynamics that there was a shortcut of the microphones phantom power, this did not sound very well, I just cut this part. But I was afraid my mics could have been damaged ;) I did not apply any compression, thus, be careful with you loudspeakers ... The recording was made with 50cm AB recording setup.

        "description": "I'm attempting to create a controllable thunderstorm for a film, and this is my first legitimate attempt.\r\n\r\nThis recording consists of 4 samples of rain, and another 3 samples of rain+thunder that I recorded one afternoon.\r\n\r\nEquipment used was the inbuilt mics on a Roland R-26, and a Sennheiser ME66 into a Sound Devices 702.  The clips were recorded at 96kHz/24-bit, and they were processed at 48kHz/24-bit.\r\n\r\nFor processing, I put the samples into Kyma, and crossfaded for texture.\r\n\r\nThe howling wind sound is an analog-style low pass filter's frequency, level, and resonance being controlled by a Wacom Intuos4 pen/tablet.\r\n\r\nThe rain slowly swells, which was done by changing parameters of a granular reverb.\r\n\r\nThe thunder was also controlled by the Wacom tablet, with X, Y, and Z (pressure) dimensions mapped to making the thunder swell in level, density, and texture.\r\n\r\nThis could have been output in surround, but I don't have that many monitors ;).  This style of \"rain-synthesis\" can also go on indefinitely.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what you think of the quality of this track; eg, if it sounds real, if the wind sounds ridiculous, too much thunder, etc.\r\n\r\nUse this sound (wherever) if you want to, or let me know if you'd like an mp3 of this, or for it to last longer.  I'd like some credit if you do use it, but it's no big deal.\r\n\r\nA blog is up explaining the method of creation here:\r\n<a href=\"http://www.kylehughesaudio.com/2/post/2013/02/tempest.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.kylehughesaudio.com/2/post/2013/02/tempest.html</a>",
