The owner did eventually shut it off about 10s after the recording ends, so you can sleep well tonight.\n\n<b>This sound is <u>not</u> in the public domain.

I will get more varied honks with future recordings. It's a very old-school kind of manly honk that all modern cars lack.\r\n\r\nGear: GoPro 3+ Black edition. Sample was picked out from a video I was making.\r\n48,000Hz / 16bit\r\n\r\nI will get some more on my Zoom H2N/H4Ns in coming weeks\r\n\r\nCar image is here: <a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/vLkpv#f7tu5vD\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://imgur.com/a/vLkpv#f7tu5vD</a>",

I generated a white noise at 0.8 amplitude, I added a distortion effect, then I used a progressive pitch variation, a hard limit and the Tromolo effect. Then, I recorded a noise of a plastic water bottle crushed. I generated a sinusoidal wave at 440 Hz. I used the effect \u201cWahwah\u201d to create a sound like that of a beating heart. And I added a silence to suppose the victim\u2019s death. I normalized to avoid saturation. This sound tells the story of a driver who takes his car, starts it, rolls, accelerates, another user honks to warn of danger and the driver collides with a pedestrian.\n\nPour la description du son selon la typologie de Schaeffer  : continu complexe et impulsion tonique\nMasse : \u00ab sons cannel\u00e9s \u00bb \ntimbre harmonique : acide \nGrain :  rugueux \nAllure : lente et rapide sur la fin\nDynamique : d\u00e9but du son doux et graduel",

Hopefully, the biker was only slightly injured, but it could have been really worse. \nRecorded from my balcony in July 2024 with an Olympus LS-P4 and Immersive Soundscapes EarSight Nano microphones in AB position (about 40cm). \nFade in/out and high pass filter at 60Hz -6dB/oct applied in Audacity. \n(If you want to use this sound as a mono audio file, you may have to delete one channel to avoid phase issues).",

A fly fails to escape through the ceiling. A horn honks.  No sirens, for 10 minutes, very odd.",

Spot Fx such as thunder and lighting were relevant inclusions to amplify that low rainy mood. A radio background was implemented to give the soundscape variety in what one would normally hear from the car, and a passing horn spot Fx was another in similar vain (with automated panning to give the perception that a car has went past with the horn - basic surround sound).",

        "description": "Afternoon downtown atmosphere in Florence, Italy. \nI made this recording from a 5th floor balcony in Florence (Italy),  at about 7:30PM during a warm spring afternoon. \nOne can hear traffic (mostly mopeds and cars), noises from the surroundings, voices from time to time, and martins flying in the clear skies. In the distance, a police siren from #2:36 to 3:45, and a train horn at #5:19. \nRecorded in April 2024 with an Olympus LS-P4 and Micbooster Clippy Stereo EM272 microphones (Primo em272) in AB position. \nFade in/out and high pass filter at 30Hz -6dB/oct applied in Audacity. \n(If you want to use this sound as a mono audio file, you may have to delete one channel to avoid phase issues).",

He puts on his breaks, honks his horn, and yells \"Hey!\" as if threatening to try to do something drastic. The train gives a warning whistle in reply, but the teenager pays no heed. He sees a small rise in the road, so he assumes that, if he drives with enough speed, he might fly over the train and onto the other side. So he accelerates towards the train, but the rise fails to give him enough hight, and he crashes into the train.

In the background, hum from the city, and sometimes, squeaking noise from the brakes of the metro stopping in the nearby outdoor subway station. Quite a typical Parisian atmosphere, in my opinion. \nRecorded in October 2023 with an Olympus LS-P4 and Ohrwurm 3D binaural microphones. \nFade in/out and high pass filter at 60Hz -6dB/oct applied in Audacity. \n(If you want to use this sound as a mono audio file, you may have to delete one channel to avoid phase issues).",

        "description": "March LV from John Cage\u2019s \"A Dip in the Lake\" interpreted by recording in Chicago on March 14th, 2020. The recording locations include Orchard St. and Belmont Ave. In Arlington Heights, W. Diversey Ave./N. Paulina St. and N. Wolcott Ave., the lake off Glencoe, and the lake \u201cfurther out.\u201d The recording guides the listener through the city through the simplicity of birds, a mix of car ride tunes and news in an Uber, and marching to privacy at the lake. Three noteworthy sounds from the recording include the ringing of a bell and the honking of a horn on a child\u2019s bicycle (2\u201909\u201d), a news report on the state of COVID-19 at the time (2\u201957\u201d), and the crashing of waves (4\u201931\u201d). The lake off Glencoe is a really inspiring spot to reflect, especially during the time of hardship this recording was captured during. The roughness of my footsteps with the wind blowing towards the end of the piece really hits home with the mentality of marching forward even in times of adversity.",

Back in November 2019, there was a big demonstration with hundreds of tractors in the streets, blocking traffic in protest of a new agricultural policy. \n\nThe resulting chaos of the horns of all the cars trapped in traffic resulted in this recording. I used it as the base for this electroacoustic piece of mine, which was made with all the sounds I recorded that day: <a href=\"https://gabgallard.bandcamp.com/track/10555-tiergarten\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://gabgallard.bandcamp.com/track/10555-tiergarten</a>",

Distant Car horn at 3:57 .\nSince this was recorded on a busy Weeknight at 7PM, a lot of distant car doors and people picking up and dropping off kiddos for basketball practice, choir practice and other ancient extracurricular activities.  There is a particularly good door open and slam and muted conversations at 6:43 to 6:56  and again at 7:17\nStereo recording made on Thursday night March 29th, 2018 using a Sound Devices 702 and an AudioTechnica BP4025 stereo microphone.  The original was recorded at the very high sample rate of 196HZ.\nEnjoy a  town winding down and internalizing on a cold, drippy wet night in either very late Winter, or very early Spring.",

Some people are talking, then the calliope makes an attempt at the Highland Reel, then shifts it to a higher key.  Car horn.  Wind noise.  I am walking briskly away from the area.  At 1:15 there is heavy traffic on the Marietta Pike.  At 1:44 I am approaching some fixed noise source on the right- a compressor or blower?  A car pulls in nearby, tire noise on stones.  Wind noise.  Throughout the track there is the calliope in the distance.  Wind blown leaves.  Birdsong.  All the while I am walking briskly down the street.  At 4:15 you hear my footsteps.  From 5:15 to 5:27 an antique car passes- unusual engine sound.  I cross over the street through some grass.  Birdsong and calliope.  At 7:15 I am in an alley. I pass a man and a woman talking.  At 8:00 I cross another street- I wait for a car to pass.  I approach some men working at a church- some are trimming a hedge, some are installing flashing.  At 9:16 a large semi passes on the street ahead.  I walk beside another heavily traveled street- Columbia Avenue.  A plane passes overhead.",

        "description": "<b>Majestic chunky waves ride in and hit the cliffs broadside-on, with heavy thuds and impressive splashdowns from the plumes or walls of spray that shoot up, with beautifully discreet atmospheric foghorn (actually 'whistle') soundings coming into and out of focus. Impressive deep heavy rumbles from sea action on cliff base immediately below recorder.</b>\n\nThis is the lower of two concurrent recordings I made here on 12 March 2014, near Land's End, Penwith, Cornwall, UK. <b><a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/Philip_Goddard/sounds/693575/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The upper one</a></b> was directly overlooking Zawn Wells, a quite narrow small inlet, while this one was a little lower and 'round the corner' off to the left, just a little down the cliff slope, and rather blocked off from the sea action in Zawn Wells, and capturing instead a lot of rumbling from sea action against the cliff directly below there.\n\nI hurried like a bat out of hell from my early afternoon recording session at Zawn Rinny, by Gwennap Head, for I realized that there could be super-duper sea dramatics around Zawn Wells, and made it from the former in just an hour, with my quite heavy rucksack making that quite an achievement for me. But as I was getting near I had a heart-sink moment and disappointment, for the Longships 'foghorn' was sounding. I'd have welcomed a <em>real</em> foghorn &#8212; they have style! &#8212; but the bland little rather high-pitched 'whistle' really made it pointless to record.\n\nWhen I arrived, overlooking Zawn Wells, the sea dramatics were great, but that dratted 'foghorn' was continuing, repeating every 10 seconds. I was about to pick up my pack again and make for the Land's End car park to start my return hitch-hike to Exeter, but prudently checked that choice by means of a procedure I nowadays call <i><b>Helpfulness Testing</b></i> (look that up in my <b><a href=\"https://www.clarity-of-being.org/glossary.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Glossary page</a></b>), and got a strong indication that, regardless of how I was feeling about that confounded 'foghorn', it would be much better that I still spend an hour making two concurrent recordings here as though there were no such issue.\n\nHowever, once the recording was running, I started getting tingling up my spine, and beginning to recognise that I might be getting something really special here. It was reminding me of the musical 'device' I'd used in movement 3 of my <i><b><a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard-music.co.uk/sym6.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Symphony 6</a></b></i>, where I had a high D tone running through most of that movement, which gave the music (a symbolic battle of humans against 'the elements' on the mountain K2) a strange 'metaphysical' quality and sense of some powerful 'higher' purpose. Similarly here, that eerie distant whistle tone drifting in and out of audibility was giving the impression of intensifying the sense of drama, and suggesting some deep metaphysical aspect of it all. On editing the recordings afterwards I found that impression was reinforced.\n\nI did have one regret, though. I noticed how both recordings had failed to reproduce clearly the movement of the waves from left to right; there was only a vague impression of that happening. &#8212; It wasn't till 2016, when I started using the PCM-D100 recorder, that I realized how atrocious the M10's stereo imaging really was. How I then wished for being able to repeat that spectacular with the D100 and hear the exact position of each wave as it moves across the soundstage! I did enhance the stereo image of both recordings with software, but they're still nothing like they'd be if they'd been recorded with the D100.\n\nUnfortunately, it would be a quite rare occurrence that a sufficiently large swell would accompany very light local wind and offshore sea fog, so the chances of my being able to get a repeat performance, especially with the fog 'horn', would be virtually nil.\n\n<b>Advisory</b>\n\nFor a reasonable approximation to the loudness of the original soundscape, a playing volume of <b>3dB above</b> a normal sensible volume level is needed.\n\nHigh-grade headphones are particularly recommended in order to hear all the detail. Also, because the stereo imaging has been enhanced, that may cause a certain phasiness or phase cancellation points when you listen through certain speakers, whereas that effect doesn't occur when listening through headphones.\n\n<img alt=\"This recording taking place\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/140312_recording_sea_dramatics_near_land%27s_end,_from_pordenack_point_cliffs_02.jpg\">\n<i>From the upper recorder position, overlooking Zawn Wells (inlet on right), during this recording.</i>\n\n<img alt=\"This recording taking place \u2014 higher view\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/140312_recording_sea_sound_near_land%27s_end,_from_pordenack_point_cliffs.jpg\">\n<i>From same position, getting the view out to the Land's End complex.</i>\n\n<b>Techie stuff:</b>\nThe recorder was a Sony PCM-M10, with just one furry windshield &#8212; a R&#248;de DeadKitten (original, more effective, version) &#8212;, and placed on a Zipshot Mini tripod (more midi than mini).\n\nPost-recording processing was to apply EQ in Audacity to correct for the muffling effect of the windshield, and more recent processing with the A1 Stereo Control VST plugin (160% widening).\n\n<b>Please remember to give this recording a rating &#8212; Thank you! <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\"></b>",

Sometimes a car passing, a dog baking and sometime a human voice. Most of the time just the rain in he gutter on plants, trees, on the street and on he cars and the far and sometimes close thunder. There is a great variation in rain, wind and thunder sound-level.\r\n\r\nMy metaphor on this recording is getting older, disability, death represented by thunder, wind and rain and the daily life that continues far away in the background represented by the other sounds in the background. \r\nLife is meaningless , so enjoy it!\r\n\r\nUseful as background in film, movie, game and radio-play etc. Pick out your part!\r\nOr.... Fall asleep on this recording?  \r\nSwami klankbeeld ;-) Haha\r\n\r\nRemarks:\r\n00.20 dog barking\r\n02.16 dog barking\r\n02.35 man shouting something shortly\r\n03.10 dog barking\r\n03.27 bike\r\n06.45 car\r\n07.37 car\r\n08.50 car coming and shut down smashing doors\r\n09.55 car\r\n13.05 closing garage door\r\n14.26 car horn\r\n17.07 closing aluminium indoor shutters\r\n35.15-78.30 high altitude thunder and strong winds and heavy rains, all coming in large waves\r\n51.20 car\r\n55.14 car horn\r\n78.30-end; last rain and thunder and gutter-noise to the end of recording.\r\n\r\n<b>WARNING!</b> Play on low level, because the levels variate between -48 and 0 dB.\r\n\r\nRecorded; starting July 27th 2013 11 pm, out of second floor window in calm suburban environment in the Netherlands. Using two Primo EM172 omni microphones in AB45 setting in a DIY blimp > Sony PCM D50. \r\nSound-correction for blimps with Audacity (from1-16kHz from 0 to +9dB log, >16kHz +9dB). \r\n\r\nThis is a modern high quality -q10 (1500kbps) OGG Vobis compression file (48000Hz/16bit). The quality is almost as good  as the 48/24-WAV original file. You can easily use this file in HD-film and HIFI music-tracks. The sound-quality is, after this compression technique still very high The file size reduction is about 75% of the 2304kbps WAV-track\r\n\r\nWhen you use this sound it would be nice if you spent a voluntarily donation to freesound.  \r\nYOU ALWAYS HAVE TO CREDIT/ATTRIBUTE me (klankbeeld) and freesound.org in your work if you use this sound.

        "description": "<b>Majestic chunky waves ride in and hit the cliffs broadside-on, with heavy thuds and impressive splashdowns from the plumes or walls of spray that shoot up, with beautifully discreet atmospheric foghorn (actually 'whistle') tone coming into and out of focus.</b>\n\nThis is the upper of two concurrent recordings I made here on 12 March 2014, near Land's End, Penwith, Cornwall, UK. This one directly overlooks Zawn Wells, a quite narrow small inlet, while <b><a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/Philip_Goddard/sounds/693576/\" rel=\"nofollow\">the other one</a></b> was a little lower and 'round the corner' off to the left, just a little down the cliff slope, and rather blocked off from the sea action in Zawn Wells, and capturing instead a lot of heavy rumbling from sea action against the cliff directly below there.\n\nI hurried like a bat out of hell from my early afternoon recording session at Zawn Rinny, by Gwennap Head, for I realized that there could be super-duper sea dramatics around Zawn Wells, and made it from the former in just an hour, with my quite heavy rucksack making that quite an achievement for me. But as I was getting near I had a heart-sink moment and disappointment, for I realized that the Longships 'foghorn' was sounding. I'd have welcomed a <em>real</em> foghorn &#8212; they have style! &#8212; but the bland little rather high-pitched 'whistle' really made it pointless to record.\n\nWhen I arrived, overlooking Zawn Wells, the sea dramatics were great, but that dratted 'foghorn' was continuing, repeating every 10 seconds. I was about to pick up my pack again and make for the Land's End car park to start my return hitch-hike to Exeter, but prudently checked that choice by means of a procedure I nowadays call <i><b>Helpfulness Testing</b></i> (look that up in my <b><a href=\"https://www.clarity-of-being.org/glossary.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Glossary page</a></b>), and got a strong indication that, regardless of how I was feeling about that confounded 'foghorn', it would be much better that I still spend an hour making two concurrent recordings here as though there were no such issue.\n\nHowever, once the recording was running, I started getting tingling up my spine, and beginning to recognise that I might be getting something really special here. It was reminding me of the musical 'device' I'd used in movement 3 of my <i><b><a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard-music.co.uk/sym6.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Symphony 6</a></b></i>, where I had a high D tone running through most of that movement, which gave the music (a symbolic battle of humans against 'the elements' on the mountain K2) a strange 'metaphysical' quality and sense of some powerful 'higher' purpose. Similarly here, that eerie distant whistle tone drifting in and out of audibility was giving the impression of intensifying the sense of drama, and suggesting some deep metaphysical aspect of it all. On editing the recordings afterwards I found that impression was reinforced.\n\nI did have one regret, though. I noticed how both recordings had failed to reproduce clearly the movement of the waves from left to right; there was only a vague impression of that happening. &#8212; It wasn't till 2016, when I started using the PCM-D100 recorder, that I realized how atrocious the M10's stereo imaging really was. How I then wished for being able to repeat that spectacular with the D100 and hear the exact position of each wave as it moves across the soundstage! I did enhance the stereo image of both recordings with software, but they're still nothing like they'd be if they'd been recorded with the D100.\n\nUnfortunately, it would be a quite rare occurrence that a sufficiently large swell would accompany very light local wind and offshore sea fog, so the chances of my being able to get a repeat performance, especially with the fog 'horn', would be virtually nil.\n\n<b>Advisory</b>\n\nFor a reasonable approximation to the loudness of the original soundscape, a playing volume of <b>3dB above</b> a normal sensible volume level is needed.\n\nHigh-grade headphones are particularly recommended in order to hear all the detail. Also, because the stereo imaging has been enhanced, that may cause a certain phasiness or phase cancellation points when you listen through certain speakers, whereas that effect doesn't occur when listening through headphones.\n \n<img alt=\"View from recorder position during this recording\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/140312_atlantic_swell_surging_into_zawn_wells,_near_land%27s_end.jpg\"><i>From the upper recorder position, overlooking Zawn Wells (inlet on right), during this recording.</i>\n\n<img alt=\"View of recorder positions from other side of chasm\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/140312_atlantic_swell_hitting_cliffs_by_zawn_wells,_near_land%27s_end_02.jpg\">\n<i>From same position, getting the view out to the Land's End complex.</i>\n\n<b>Techie stuff:</b>\nThe recorder was a Sony PCM-M10, with just one furry windshield &#8212; a R&#248;de DeadKitten (original, more effective, version) &#8212;, and placed on a full-size Zipshot tripod.\n\nPost-recording processing was to apply EQ in Audacity to correct for the muffling effect of the windshield, and more recent processing with the A1 Stereo Control VST plugin (160% widening).\n\n<b>Please remember to give this recording a rating &#8212; Thank you! <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\"></b>",

Than the close slamming doors and car-horns will not kill your hard freezing work. Do not record on a lower level, cause you miss to much of the ambiance details (the quiet sounds).

As far as I know, there is no down-town so close to the fields (see geaotag)in Europe, but I could be wrong. The traffic just behind the old city-wall.\r\nPeople let there dog's (and kids ;-) out here. \r\nCause it's cold and cloudy between winter and spring there are not many birds around. The carillon (bells) of the st. Jan's cathedral and the far city-hall give this recording the image of a city in the distance. Sometimes the trains (left) are audible. Even the audio signal of the traffic-light 300m away is there. And the two planes are for free.\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://static.panoramio.com/photos/medium/86820386.jpg\" />\r\nI know this is a long recording, but I like to listen to the details.

The city was built on a low sandy hill in the wetlands, which was wet with the rivers 'Dommel' and 'Dieze'. In 1579 the Spaniards still managed to take the city.'s-Hertogenbosch became a Catholic stronghold. Frederick Hendrik in 1629 called in the help of the famous water-engeneer Leeghwater. Thanks to his dike system the land could be insinuated (flooded) and so the people of 's-Hertogenbosch got back the city into their own hands. Through the work of Leeghwater the area I'm standing named 'Bossche Broek' became a controllable wetland, a marshy parkland area along the lower reaches of the river Dommel.\r\nThese days the area still can be flooded when the surrounding rivers (Maas, Aa, Dieze and Dommel)are to high. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRecorded: March 2 2013 2.30-3 pm, Singelgrachtweg, Bossche Broek, 's-Hertogenbosch. Holland (Netherlands).\r\nWeather: wind 0-2 bft between W \u2013  NEN, temp 3c, cloudy. \r\nGear: Rode NT4 (batt. Power) in Rode Blimp > Sony PCM D50. Edit: Audacity freeware.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you use this sound it would be nice if you spent a voluntarily donation to freesound.  \r\nYOU ALWAYS HAVE TO CREDIT/ATTRIBUTE me (klankbeeld) and freesound.org in your work if you use this sound.

As the sound in the building comes from below and from above. Left and right of the microphones, the wind howls through gaps under the doors. Sometimes traffic is audible.
