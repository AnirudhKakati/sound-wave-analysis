        "description": "I recorded these sounds during travelling on the Metro Line 2 in Budapest, from station \u00d6rs Vez\u00e9r Tere to station Blaha Lujza t\u00e9r. I started recording sounds when the train was slowing down to the second station, Pillang\u00f3 utca, and the recording is ended when the train was arrived to the station 'Blaha'. If you use train simulator, you have MP3 editor and you are looking for sound effects, you may find some.This is a good chance for me to made this recording because the train always move fastly and very rarely stops in the tunnel between two stations.At the first minute when the train arrived to 'Pillang\u00f3 utca' the CP engine was on and it is ideal looping sound effect. Going into the deep at 1:40, the train is going very slowly into the tunnel. At 2:16 There is another train which is going fastly on the backward railway in the tunnel. It has great echo sounds. The sound is an ideal looping sound for slow-moving, I think. At 2:48 the train was accelerating a bit and you can hear cleanly the looping motor sound. at 3:23 the train stopped in the tunnel for 20 seconds, then arrived to station Stadionok. At 4:33 it is moving to the next station, Keleti P\u00e1lyaudvar. I like hearing at 4:47 and 4:55 at any time when it is going onto the rail-crossings. The station Keleti P\u00e1lyaudvar is much deeper then the station Stadionok. You cannot hear the motor sounds of the train. This is a good looping example for fast-moving sound. When the train was arrived at the station the CP engine was started again and you can hear it almost clearly.",

I placed the microphone in the area where you cross between cars (which is on the upper level). Note that the sound of people can often be heard so sorry about that. The right microphone was closer to the sound source.\n\n27:37 passing by RR crossing bells (and also once more before this time)\n47:00 some good rail squeal around this time\n\nrecorded with a Sony ICD UX560\n\nLeave a comment. I would love to see what you do with my sounds!",

        "description": "mysterious sound during the journey by train\n\nI recorded this sound in a train between stations Kozarovce - Nova bana (Slovakia). When the train passes through the track between those stations, passengers can hear sound, similar to braking truck. One friend told me the story behind this mysterious sound: Once upon a time, overnight express crashed to the truck in the rail crossing which is located between those stations. The truck was destroyed because train pushed the truck a few hundred meters away. The driver was dead and his body was not buried in its entirety. His spirit settled there and passengers have to listen to a sound of braking truck. Railwaymen supposedly rebuilded this part of a track, but the sound didn't disappear.\nyou can hear two different sounds. First is on a track between Nova Bana - Kozarovce, second is in the same truck but in return path. Recorded with Zoom H1 internal mic. The recording is original, I just normalized and selected the right parts.",

The recorder was placed with microphones up in the window facing seat in the silent zone (thus very little and istrant human voices and no privacy issues).

        "description": "Field recording of a diesel passenger train ('Pacer' operated by Northern Rail) passing by. Sorry about the quick ending, but a dog started barking and I had to cut that off as it ruined the recording. (I'll try and get the dog recording up as soon as possible)\r\n\r\nI was waiting for about 3 minutes for the train to depart from the station (see geotag) when it began to move off in the distance and passed under the pedestrian bridge over the track I recorded this on. Fair spring evening weather, I had been sick earlier on but had managed to get out to record this- thank heaven!\r\nMaybe it's a better version of my previous Train1.wav (but that was recorded somewhere else up from the station) <a href=\"http://freesound.org/people/kwahmah_02/sounds/250079/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://freesound.org/people/kwahmah_02/sounds/250079/</a>\r\n\r\nRecorded 14th May 2015 with a 5th gen iPod touch.

The main focus in such a project would be on generating a score by merging a few sounds in the background of the soundtrack (such as bumping or breaking) with specific vehicle sound effects (such as braking). Loops would be used to affect pre-composed music, using live data to change the mix and instrumental direction (such as the dynamics, texture or timbre), or even the pitch, rhythm or tempo), Moreover, the musical soundtrack for racing vehicle gameplay could be stored in a memory card to use in digital sport car sounds unit that convenient sound effects according to the processes, which is essential to participate in the training driver by granting the user with more information.

The main focus in such a project would be on generating a score by merging a few sounds in the background of the soundtrack (such as bumping or breaking) with specific vehicle sound effects (such as braking). Loops would be used to affect pre-composed music, using live data to change the mix and instrumental direction (such as the dynamics, texture or timbre), or even the pitch, rhythm or tempo), Moreover, the musical soundtrack for racing vehicle gameplay could be stored in a memory card to use in digital sport car sounds unit that convenient sound effects according to the processes, which is essential to participate in the training driver by granting the user with more information. In real life, the driver has more sensory information.",

I was pretty close to the tracks so the driver gives a couple blows on his horn, just in case I failed to see the gigantic train coming. Lots of scrapes and metallic sounds. There is a huge dynamic range and this recording is best if you download it and listen loudly, but be nice to your ears.\r\nRecorded with a stereo pair of Sennheiser MKH 8020 mics into a modified Marantz PMD661.",

I will upload the sound of just the clang of the door if that's suits everyone better.\n\nIf you do use this, please credit me and comment how you've used it. I would love to hear how this has benefited everyone. If you have a link to the work you've used it in, I'd love to see!\n\nThanks,\n\nBowesy",

The sequences are taken with a video camera from a fixed point of view towards only one direction, south, with different sequences. The mic is a micro stereo Sony connected with the camera. The idea was to study the simultaneity of the several plans of the image. The camera is by hand. In the video it does not succeed anything of relevant if not the passage of the unexpected train, the sounds of the motor of the level crossing, some voice or noise. The time is suspended in the recur of the events. Actually the level-crossing no longer exists.    \nYou can see the video here:\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSNll7e4F1g\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSNll7e4F1g</a>",

        "description": "300Hz electrical hum heard on 81-717 metro trains, found commonly in Eastern European subway systems. (Moscow, Saint-Petersburg, Kyiv, Budapest, Prague, Warsaw, and Sofia metros, to name a few). \nThis is produced by the BPSN-5U2 converter (BPSN stands for auxiliary power supply block), a set of two static inverters that convert 750V (or 825V) DC from the third rail to 80V DC for the onboard control systems in the cabin, and 220V AC for the interior lights. One of the converters produces a 300Hz tone, the other produces a 200Hz tone. On later trains, the 200Hz tone is inaudible due to the replacement of the secondary inverter.\nLater 81-717 trains have had these power supplies replaced with quieter BPSN-5U2M or BBE units, or by completely silent BPN-115 and DIP power supplies.\n\nThese are several variants of the sound, as heard in different cities.\n\nMade in <a href=\"http://beepbox.co\" rel=\"nofollow\">beepbox.co</a>",

Blaak is an underground mainline station so a good place for recording trains regardless of weather conditions.

There is also some noise created by my feet as I step in the gravel between the tracks.\nThis sound was recorded using a MZ-NH700 MD, via MIC-IN with a cheap condenser microphone.",

The other is during covid19.\n\n<b>How I did compare;</b>\nOn May 13, 2019 I made an audio recording from thirteen minutes past seven in the evening.\nOn May 4, 2020, I made a sound recording at the same time of the evening.\nI put these two tracks together exactly in time in Audacity.\n<b>I adjusted the sound level of each track to the sparks that the electric trains make when they pass from one energy network to another. That is precisely in front of the microphone.</b>\nThen I looked where the quietest parts of both sound recordings coincided. I used these three minutes for the comparison.\nIn this audio file you hear the sound change every fifteen seconds.\nThe audio file starts with the corona-free part in 2019.\n\nBoth original audio files can be found below.\n2019: <a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/klankbeeld/sounds/469990/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://freesound.org/people/klankbeeld/sounds/469990/</a>\n2020: <a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/klankbeeld/sounds/516742/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://freesound.org/people/klankbeeld/sounds/516742/</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Herautstraat_%27s-Hertogenbosch.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"Herautstraat &#039;s-Hertogenbosch\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Herautstraat_%27s-Hertogenbosch.jpg/256px-Herautstraat_%27s-Hertogenbosch.jpg\"></a>\npicture 2019\n\n<a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Herautstraat_%27s-Hertogenbosch_mei_2020.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"Herautstraat &#039;s-Hertogenbosch mei 2020\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/Herautstraat_%27s-Hertogenbosch_mei_2020.jpg/256px-Herautstraat_%27s-Hertogenbosch_mei_2020.jpg\"></a>\npicture 2020\n\nDate/time 2019: May 13th Monday 2019, 7.13 pm\nDate/time 2020: May 4th Monday 2020, 7.13 pm\n\nWeather 2019: 15c, clear sky, wind NE 3bft with gusts to 30km/h, 1037 hPa, humidity 34%.\nWeather 2020: 15c, sun and some clouds, wind NE 3bft with gusts to 24km/h, 1020 hPa, humidity 47%. \n\nLocation; Herautstraat, \u2018s-Hertogenbosch (Den Bosch), Noord-Brabant, Netherlands (Holland), Europe GPS: 51.68786 5.29119\n\nGear chain: Sennheiser mkh30/50 MS, in Rycote cyclone small, windjammer &gt; Sound Devices 302 &gt;Tascam dr-100 Mk2.

The goal was to create a train sound.\n\nFirst, I recorded a sound of a spoon turning in an empty cup of tea during 7sec. \nThen, I tried to play with the rhythm of the sound : I copy-pasted this sound 7 times under the principal track and I shifted all the copies with the tool \"time slip\" with different shift (before or after the principal track). After that, I mixed all the tracks in one.\n\nTo get this sound more realistic, I changed the pitch of the track (-10) and added a reverb (7%). Because the amplitude was really low, I amplified the sound, but not beyond 0db.",

It was recorded in an arcade adjoining outbuildings of a factory converted to studio and office spaces. I excused myself from rehearsal to catch the recording shortly after learning a woman I'd been seeing for about a year was through with our relationship. I won an award in composition and sound design for the work I did for the play.",
