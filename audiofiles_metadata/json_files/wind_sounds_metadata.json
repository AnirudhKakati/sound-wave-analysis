I recorded for 18 minutes and I used audacity to edit it.\r\n\r\nHope this sound is useful for you!",

It is situated between Langeoog to its west, and Wangerooge to its east.\r\nSpiekeroog covers an area of 18.25 km\u00b2, the shortest distance to the mainland is 5.7 km. The island is - with the exception of fire and rescue vehicles - free of cars. A daily ferry service from the harbour of Neuharlingersiel connects the island with the German mainland.\r\n\r\nYou can listen to an 10 minutes soundtrack from the shore of Spiekeroog, I recorded in the early morning of the 24th of may 2014. This is improved by me with audacity software to minimise the disturbance of the wind my iPhone-Micro.\r\n\r\nEnjoy and\r\nThanks for listening\r\nthe very real Horst from town Duisburg in Germany\r\n",

        "description": "On 6th February 2013 I took out with me to the Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK, a set of Woodstock Gregorian Tenor Chimes and two sets of Music of the Spheres Gypsy wind chimes - the Soprano and Mezzo sizes, the sounds of which latter two mesh together beautifully.\n\nI was actually expecting a gale as I experienced for my recordings a week before, especially as there had been a gale overnight, but in fact the wind had eased down to a mere 'strong' (force 6 on the Beaufort scale), but it was colder than last time, so this was bound to be more challenging for me (I have Raynaud's disease, the cold extremities problem). Because of my expectations of a gale, I made for the same spot as last week - near the top of the track ascending through the valley-side woods to join the Hunters' Path just as it emerges from the woods at the top.\n\nThis proved still to get a very useful variation of wind strength to work the chimes, also with very nice sound as the wind gusts came through the trees - but generally nothing as spectacularly dramatic as I'd had last week.\n\nI did actually try combining Gregorian and Gypsy Chimes - but these turned out to be incompatible, together producing a chaotic discordant gibberish, and I deleted the two recordings I made with that combination - but fortunately I then went on to make the best of what I had taken out this day, and the resultant recordings have turned out quite beautifully, with a nice background sound from the River Teign far below, and the periodic larger gusts of wind coming through the trees having a lovely detail of sound and helping to give the soundscape a particularly three-dimensional quality.\n\nThis recording is of the Music of the Spheres Gypsy Mezzo chimes, tuned to an Eastern European Gypsy scale, which gives them a hauntingly doleful sound.\n\nOne curious thing is that the Gypsy chimes (only) at this particular spot on this particular day produced an odd non-musical tapping sound at each strike of the tubes on the central 'striker' - something very apparent in this recording. I had not heard that sound in my previous recordings of these chimes, including those made with the Gypsy Chimes hanging on the very same branches last week - really quite weird, and I'm baffled as to the cause of that.\n\nBoth the Gypsy sets were doing that, but not the Gregorian chimes, and also my afternoon recording of the Gypsy Soprano chimes down below, by the River Teign, did not produce that tapping sound at all. Just maybe - I wonder if this was a temperature thing, and the air temperature of about 4 degrees C in this high position was just low enough to change the physical properties of those chimes' strikers to cause that tapping sound.\n\nThis is a 5-minute excerpt from the 20+ minutes full recording.\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/recording-nr-top-of-woods-above-fingle-bridge.jpg\">\n<i>This photo shows my recording studio for this occasion, but taken the previous week during my gale sequence - almost at the top of the north side of the Teign Gorge, and facing obliquely over the valley, so that the gusts of wind come from the right and then some come swirling around here before they continue across or down into the valley as they will. The sets of chimes visible are the Gypsy Mezzo (left, and further away) and the Pluto (right, not used this time).</i><br>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/track-high-above-fingle-bridge.jpg\">\n<i>Looking the other way from near the top of the track ascending from Fingle Bridge, which latter is hidden way down below. The recorder is about 15 metres behind me, just a little down the slope from this track.</i>\n\nRecording made with a Sony PCM-M10 on a Velbon mini-tripod, using the built-in microphones covered with a Rode Dead Kitten windshield. I have used Audacity to apply a custom EQ profile to correct for the high frequency muffling caused by the windshield.\n\n<b>Please note that only very good speakers / headphones with a very extended and flat frequency response will do this recording real justice.  Please also note that the volume level of this recording has been carefully adjusted for listening purposes, and ALL my recordings so far are meant to be listened to with a volume setting that would give a realistic level for playback of CLASSICAL music (a large but not exceptional symphony orchestra). If you have the right volume setting, you should not need to change that setting from one recording of mine to another.</b>\n<p><i>(Later note: This recording - with better sound than here - is one of my CD-quality downloads, and can be found in <a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">my e-Store</a>.)</i></p>\n<p><b>Please remember to give this recording a rating! <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\"></b></p>",

        "description": "<b>A real 'Wow!' wind chimes ensemble hung up from trees high up in the Teign Gorge:</b>\n\n<b>1. Woodstock Chimes of Olympos</b> (relatively low-pitched Ancient Greek scale)\n\n<b>2. Music of the Spheres Gypsy Mezzo</b> (Eastern European Gypsy scale)\n\n<b>3. Music of the Spheres Gypsy Soprano</b> (ditto, but lower, and different mode on that scale)\n\n<b>Most appropriately, a strong emotional atmosphere that I pick up from this ensemble's sound is that of an unimaginably strong and persistent sense of <i>SURPRISE</i>, as though felt from some very deep source. The Gypsy chimes on their own sound deeply melancholic, but with any of the others I've tried with them they give this sense of great surprise, especially when pentatonic chimes are in the mix. The Olympos chimes spice things up nicely, giving some dissonant touches reminiscent of some music of B&#233;la Bart&#243;k. Sounds like fun? &#8212; Well, at least this errant monkey thinks so!</b>\n\nI recorded this on 15 April 2014, on the rough slope just below Hunting Gate, which latter marks the highest point of the Hunter's Path, high up on the north side of the Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK.\n\nThis was a particularly bold musical adventure of mine. To my ears this has come out as something incredibly beautiful, in a challenging and healthily invigorating way. We <em>need</em> our horizons and brain function opened up and broadened, even if we misguidedly view anything of the sort as anathema! This is all about (further) opening up our ability to experience life with abundance, variety and full vividness &#8212; in short, being fully human! \n\nThis took a lot of time to set up in order to get optimal balance between the different chimes and so to achieve a reasonable ensemble effect.

        "description": "On 30th January 2013 I took out with me a set of Woodstock Chimes of Pluto and two sets of Music of the Spheres Gypsy wind chimes - the Soprano and Mezzo sizes, the sounds of which latter two mesh together beautifully.\n\nI was aiming for the same recording location as I used for my previous wind chimes recordings - in November 2012 - but this time a very strong wind was blowing over the more exposed parts, and, on the Hunters' Path from Drewsteignton (Devon, UK), high up on the side of the so-called Teign Gorge above Fingle Bridge, as I was coming out of the woods that clothe the steep valley slopes I was suddenly blasted by a wind of about gale force (force 8 on the Beaufort scale), and realized that my previous recording locations here would most likely be too windy this time.\n\nSo, I withdrew very slightly back into the top of the woods, descending slightly to just below the top part of the narrow track that ascends steeply from Fingle Bridge to join the Hunters' Path, and found a suitable group of low tree branches that were sufficiently sheltered to be getting a very nice range of wind strength, from very little indeed up to 'fresh' (force 5 on the Beaufort scale).\n\nThus today was not only to be an experiment to see to what extent the Gypsy chimes could usefully be combined with any of the quite different sounding Woodstock chimes, but also an opportunity to record a gale in the woods, with wind chimes intermingled in the wind sound and indeed quite often buried in it as the most powerful gusts came. The results turned out to be interesting and very much in accordance with what I had been hankering after for as long as I'd been thinking of recording wind chimes. It is important, therefore, to enable yourself to perceive this particular day's recordings NOT as 'failed' or otherwise bad chimes recordings, but as extremely successful gale-in-the-woods recordings complete with wind chimes.\n\nAs well as the wind commotion, actually the River Teign far below was making its own quieter commotion, for it was particularly full after a lot of heavy rain, but during my whole 5+ hours' recording session I could never quite differentiate between the rushing sound of the Teign and the wind.\n\nOne thing you are bound to notice is that the degree of activity of the chimes does not tally all that much with the degree of roaring of the wind in the trees. This is because of my relatively sheltered position, so the big and powerful eddies in the flow of the air as it comes over the hill into the valley go careering through the tree branches above and around me, but the gusts that come to me and the recorder and chimes are almost all NOT those directly but smaller subsidiary eddies that come spinning off the big ones.\n\n<b>It is inevitable that the wind commotion will make particularly fatiguing listening, especially to the full-length recordings, when played through anything other than really good speakers / headphones. Please note that in the full-length recordings made on this day, ALL of them have some awesomely powerful and loud wind gusts that at times virtually drown out the chimes, so any of the excerpts here seeming louder or quieter than others is in fact misleading, as all the full length recordings have very loud and also almost quiet (albeit far from silent!) moments.\n\nPlease note also, that if you watch the waveform image here on Freesound while playing the excerpts you will NOT get the proper effect. The big wind gusts sound immensely more powerful and even frightening when you are NOT watching that, so you never know how much more the sound is going to increase, maybe to blow you and indeed the whole of Existence away! :-)</b>\n\nAnother listening tip - if you have really good and wide stereo separation you will find that the wind sound is not simply a fluctuating roar (really rather boring!), but a wonderful drama of ogreish 'wind monsters' chasing around here, there, and who knows where! The three-dimensional movement really makes an exciting drama of it all.\n\nThis recording is of the Woodstock Chimes of Pluto, plus the Music of the Spheres Gypsy Chimes, Mezzo size. The combination of the Pluto and Gypsy chimes produces a curious effect. The Pluto chimes neutralize the intense emotional feel of the Gypsy chimes, and at the same time the latter neutralize the Pluto Chimes' buoyant 'happy' feel, and the combination has a delicately wistful sound as heard on my quite reasonable computer speakers. However, on my hi-fi system comes a revelation, and the effect is not really wistful at all but an almost happy and rejoicing sound, centred in certain gentle and teasing harmonic astringencies that this chimes combination has brought us.\n\nThis is a 5-minute excerpt from the 36+ minutes full recording.\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/recording-nr-top-of-woods-above-fingle-bridge.jpg\">\n<i>This photo shows my recording studio for 30th January 2013 - almost at the top of the north side of the Teign Gorge, and facing obliquely over the valley, so that the great gusts of wind come roaring from the right and then go careering round over and down into the valley. The sets of chimes visible are the Gypsy Mezzo (left, and further away) and the Pluto (right).\nNote that the former being further away is not a bit of carelessness of mine, but a quite deliberate placement. I learnt from my first Gypsy Chimes recordings (back in November) that for best results those particular chimes need to be placed further from the microphones than the Woodstock or bamboo chimes (at least, those that I have), on account of their more penetrating and potentially overpowering tone.</i><br>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/track-high-above-fingle-bridge.jpg\">\n<i>Looking the other way from near the top of the track ascending from Fingle Bridge, which latter is hidden way down below. The recorder is about 25 metres behind me, just a little down the slope from this track.</i>\n\nRecording made with a Sony PCM-M10 on a Velbon mini-tripod, using the built-in microphones covered with a Rode Dead Kitten.\n\n<img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/arrow-long-right.gif\"> Please note that all recordings from 5th January to 2nd Feb 2013, inclusive (i.e. including this one) did not receive any correction for high-frequency attenuation caused by the new Rode Dead Kitten windshield. Subsequently I was able to work out a graphic EQ profile to apply to all recordings that used that windshield, and have applied it retrospectively - but I have no plans to go through the hassle of re-uploading here the recordings that originally missed out on that correction.\n\nTherefore, copies of recordings made in that period, including this one, which I supply on CDs or as licensed copies for commercial use, will have better sound quality and will sound clearer, more 'present', and with more precision of detail than what you hear from here.\n\n<b>Please note that only very good speakers / headphones with a very extended and flat frequency response will do this recording real justice, and, as already noted, lesser speakers / headphones would make this sound quite fatiguing to listen to.\n\nPlease also note that the volume level of this recording has been carefully adjusted for listening purposes, and ALL my recordings so far are meant to be listened to with a volume setting that would give a realistic level for playback of CLASSICAL music (a large but not exceptional symphony orchestra). If you have the right volume setting, you should not need to change that setting from one recording of mine to another.</b>\n<p><i>(Later note: This recording - with better sound than here - is one of my CD-quality downloads, and can be found in <a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">my e-Store</a>.)</i></p>\n<p><b>Please remember to give this recording a rating! <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\"></b></p>",

        "description": "On 18th February 2013 I took out with me a large and a small set of cheap bamboo chimes and three sets of quality metal wind chimes, to my regular field recording location for wind chimes - the Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK. This time, however, a brisk and fairly cold south-easterly wind drove me away from spots that would have been suitable on previous occasions, and this time eventually I settled for Hunter's Tor, a south-running rather rocky crest and spur that bounds the north side of the west end of the Teign Gorge.\n\nThis was about half the height from the valley bottom as compared with my previous recording spots here, and a result of this was that my recordings here got more bird sound, which was an improvement.\n\nHowever, the spot still turned out not to be ideal, in that, for a start, the recording was picking up some unwanted sounds from the fringing countryside. A distant cockerel belonging to one of the farm cottages down among the woods out to the west (straight ahead in the recording) kept crowing, and there was some power saw activity at times far away to the south. For the most part I removed parts of my recordings here in which the power saw was audible, though I think there is still a trace of it buried in a few of the noisier parts where the chimes were very active.\n\nAs for the cockerel, although I didn't really want it, I had little option but to accept it as 'part of the scenery'. Also, the wind gusts were sometimes a bit too strong against the recorder, so that, despite its windshield, the microphone wind noise did become a bit more intrusive than I would have chosen - albeit quite briefly and still just about within my own 'acceptable' range.\n\nI hung the chimes on small low branches of a particular well situated stunted tree, and had the recorder facing west, so that the fairly distant rushing sound of the River Teign well below was to the left. However, that sound is also combined with a general distant rushing sound of wind in the trees on the valley slopes - which is why its volume does vary during the recordings.\n\nThis recording is of ALL the chimes I brought out, so this is quite a 'symphony'! I set up both large and small sets of bamboo chimes to be closest to the recorder, with the Woodstock Chimes of Pluto (tuned to a bright and 'happy' pentatonic scale) a little behind and to their right, and the Music of the Spheres Gypsy Soprano and Mezzo chimes (tuned to an Eastern European Gypsy scale) placed rather further back on account of their more forceful and penetrating tone. The interaction of the two scales produces an intriguing effect, which seems to radically change the nature of both scales and produce a sound different from either.\n\nThis is a 5-minute excerpt from the 76 minutes full recording.\n\nAlthough this recording, played back on my hi-fi system does sound to me extremely beautiful and engaging, with very detailed and often very delicate sound, the balance between the metal and bamboo chimes is not quite as I originally intended. That is because, for logistical reasons, I had to accept the bamboo chimes being just a bit more 'forward' in the sound stage than I had intended, so they come out at times a bit more aggressively in the recording than I originally intended.\n\nIf I had moved the recorder further back in order to improve the balance, it would have had to be placed on the other side of the track (see photo below), and I was already aware that my first recording of this session, with the recorder in exactly that position, must have suffered because of the recorder's greater wind exposure there. I couldn't change the positions of the chimes in order to adjust the balance, because I was already using the five really workable hanging points (i.e. that were in reach for me!), and those, being on tree branches, were naturally non-adjustable.\n\nHowever, having said that, on further listenings to this recording on my hi-fi system I am impressed by an exquisite beauty about this whole 'symphonic' show, and regard it as a wonderful partial serendipity - such as authentic field recordings are inclined to bring. I had succeeded nicely in my intent to have a slightly more distant perspective on the Gypsy chimes, and I have succeeded in getting the Pluto chimes well balanced with them. The forwardness of the bamboo chimes actually works out very nicely, emphasizing a certain distance from and remoteness of the metal chimes.\n\nI find myself focusing sometimes on the bamboo sound, full of whole-tone scale and tritone colour, and sometimes on the metal, so gaining more variety of experience from the nearly 76-minute full recording. Also, that confounded cockerel, which got my goat so much while I was making the recording, is only just audible and thus not at all the problem that I thought it would be. And additionally, my re-listening leaves me wondering where the supposedly over-strong wind gusts were, for actually, in my books, I could hardly have got a better and more satisfying range of wind and chimes sound at this particular spot! <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\">\n\nAs to why the full recording is so long - that was not intended, and was a result of a most silly and frustrating little confusion. It is actually two consecutive recordings there, joined together. I had recorded about 45 minutes of all the chimes, and my intention was then to record the same minus the Chimes of Pluto - which combination would have sounded very different.\n\nHowever, after I'd pressed the recorder's Stop button, I was dismayed to see that the last recording was file number 1 - because I had started off with a recording of the bamboo chimes only, prior to that one, and so the apparent implication was that the supposedly just completed recording had actually never happened. I therefore assumed that when I thought I was starting the recording of all the chimes, I must have done something silly like pressing Stop instead of Pause. And so, mentally effing and blinding and gnashing and wailing, I set to, repeating the recording, because a reasonably long recording of the whole ensemble was the top priority.\n\n-- But then, as that recording neared completion I remembered a pertinent little point I'd clean forgotten about in the heat of my surprise at seeing file number 1 as being the last recording. I'd actually come out with two of the recorders, and I'd made the first recording on No. 1, after which that recorder's battery level indicator started flashing, and as my fingers were painfully cold I chose to change over to No. 2 recorder, just to avoid messing around changing batteries. So, of course my second recording was indeed file number 1 - on recorder No. 2! So, what I lost was not the original full ensemble one but the opportunity for recording the whole lot minus the Pluto chimes (I had to move on then as I was getting too cold).\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/recording-chimes-5-sets-hunters-tor-130218-1.jpg\">\n<i>This photo shows my high-level recording studio for this particular day - on Hunter's Tor, while this recording was taking place.

        "description": "On 6th February 2013 I took out with me to the Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK, a set of Woodstock Gregorian Tenor Chimes and two sets of Music of the Spheres Gypsy wind chimes. I was aiming for another full day's recording near the top of the woods above Fingle Bridge - and indeed I did last out for a full morning there - but then I had to pack up and flee because the air temperature was only about 4 degrees, with some wind-chill factor as well, and my hands and feet were causing me stress through being so painfully cold.\n\nI thought that I'd finished recording for the day, but got down to the much more sheltered Fisherman's Path by the River Teign at the west end of the steep-sided part of the valley, turning back downstream along that path just a little, and it was sufficiently sheltered and sunny just by Drogo Weir, a very noisy weir (with fish ladder) for me to sit on a wooden seat there and at last eat my packed lunch - my hands having warmed up by then.\n\nThen I started noticing that actually some modest gusts of wind were coming from the west along the very bottom of the valley here (the general wind direction being northerly), and so as soon as I'd finished eating I tried experimentally putting up and recording a set of chimes in a sequence of different positions beside the river just a little downstream from the weir (an even moderately close recording of the latter itself would have been too noisy for a pleasant 'listenable' recording).\n\n<img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/teign-weir-130218.jpg\">\n<i>Drogo Weir, photographed a couple of weeks later, with probably less than half the flow than was occurring for the current recording.</i>\n\nThis, then, and the other recordings in this particular sequence, was very much of an experiment, with a quite loud river noise and the chimes sound tending to be buried within the river sound except when wind gusts came along and made the chimes more frisky. This recording, and its other 'siblings' taken at this location, then, needs to be perceived NOT a failed chimes recording, but a recording of the river sound with chimes in the midst of it. This recording is distinctly white-noisy owing to proximity to the weir (on the right). Generally I would want quieter river sound against the chimes, but actually I had little choice here, because when I sought to get just slightly up the slope, a little more removed from the river, I lost the wind, and so could not use the chimes there anyway. But in any case this was an interesting experiment, and I could come back here another time with more favourable wind conditions and get a more restful balance of river and chimes.\n\nThe chimes in this recording are the Music of the Spheres Gypsy Soprano Chimes, tuned to an Eastern European Gypsy scale, which has a haunting quality about it when  sounded from these chimes, and often sounding like a ghostly distant organ playing (i.e. when sounding gently or in the distance).\n\nThis is a 5-minute excerpt from the 11+ minutes full recording.\n\nRecording made with a Sony PCM-M10 on a Velbon mini-tripod, using the built-in microphones covered with a Rode Dead Kitten windshield. I have used Audacity to apply a custom EQ profile to correct for the high frequency muffling caused by the windshield.\n\n<b>Please note that only very good speakers / headphones with a very extended and flat frequency response will do this recording real justice.

        "description": "<b>A 'Wow!' wind chimes ensemble hung up from trees high up in the Teign Gorge &#8212; but how come it's so emotionally ambivalent? &#8212; See further below for some degree of explanation. Chimes used this time are:</b>\n\n<b>1. Woodstock Chimes of Olympos</b> (relatively low-pitched, Ancient Greek scale)\n\n<b>2. Woodstock Chimes of Pluto</b> (moderately high-pitched, pentatonic)\n\n<b>3. Woodstock Chimes of Polaris</b> (higher-pitched, pentatonic)\n\n<b>4. Woodstock Chimes of Mercury</b> (very high-pitched pentatonic)\n\n<b>5. Woodstock Chimes of Mars</b> (very high-pitched and penetrating; not sure what scale!)\n\nI recorded this on 19 March 2014, on the rough slope just below Hunting Gate, which latter marks the highest point of the Hunter's Path, high up on the north side of the Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK.\n\nThe ensemble for this recording gives us a tug-of-war between the seriousness and deep melancholy produced by the combination of Olympos and the pentatonic chimes, and the brilliance of the Mars chimes, which latter inject a few 'major'-sounding notes at the top end. The overall emotional effect of the apparent 'major'-scale injection is to give an <em>impassioned</em> quality to the overall sound (especially where the chimes are most active), as well as lightening up the serious and melancholy tone of the rest of the ensemble. If you listen carefully and really musically you'd notice that the melancholy / sadness is still there, and it's that which is giving weight to the 'impassioned' effect brought in by the Mars chimes' injections of 'major' into the top end.\n\nActually, with regard to this recording session overall, things weren't straightforward for me. For one thing, the wind wasn't really as strong as had been forecast or indeed as what I was aiming for, and indeed there really wasn't enough wind at all for what I wanted till towards midday. For this reason certain of the recordings are really 'birds with gentle wind chimes sounds (on and off)'.\n\nAlso, I didn't get the chimes balance fully as I was after &#8212; though, generally speaking, the balance was still acceptable, there being no precise right or wrong about this. And then, as part of that issue, really the small chimes were a bit closer to the recorder than would have been ideal, and this led to the non-musical tapping sound of the strikers, particularly of the Mercury and Mars chimes, being intrusively loud on occasions, and in places the diminutive Mars chimes came out really uncomfortably loud. In this recording the Olympos chimes weren't close enough, and the effect would have been more melancholic if the balance had been better.\n\nAnother issue for me was that the sound of these combinations, although exquisitely beautiful, was musically not what I'd been expecting, and indeed in some cases (primarily involving the Gregorian chimes) was something that I wasn't keen on (actually sounding sentimental in a weird twisted way!) &#8212; though mitigated by the overall soundscape, with so many birds pronouncing their springtime territories.\n\nFor more details about the different chimes used, please go to <b><a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-windchimes.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-windchimes.htm</a></b>.\n\n<img alt=\"Four Woodstock chimes being recorded during the same session\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/140319_recording_wind_chimes_%28several_sets%29_overlooking_teign_gorge_02.jpg\">\n<i>Recording four Woodstock chimes in this session. The recorder (light grey furry windshield) is perched on a small branch rather than on a tripod.</i>\n\n<b>Techie stuff</b>\n\nThe recorder was Sony PCM-M10, with R&#248;de DeadKitten furry windshield. As already noted, it was perched on a tree branch, by means of a GorillaPod.\n\nPost-recording processing was to apply EQ in Audacity to correct for the muffling effect of the windshield &#8212; and then more recently stereo widening / sharpening-up using the VST plugin A1 Stereo Control (160% widening).\n\n<b>Please remember to give this recording a rating &#8212; Thank you!</b>&#160; <img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\">",

It's the chimes' continuous tones (very quiet at this distance) that really need to be heard.\n\n<img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/130305_recording_wind_chimes_by_hunter%27s_path,_teign_gorge.jpg\" alt=\"The chimes setup for this recording\">\n<i>The chimes setup for this recording, except that there was also the Woodstock Chimes of Pluto, which, however goes more or less unheard, together with the bamboo chimes.

        "description": "On 5th March 2013 one particular objective of the day at the Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK, was to make a long recording on Hunter's Tor of the bamboo and both Gypsy chimes, because, owing to a silly little mix-up, I missed out on doing that during my 18th February recording session there. However, that aim was to be thwarted, most likely by a little bit of 'operator error', and the 45-minute recording that I thought I had made turned out back at home to be just one second of background noise!\n\nHowever, while that recording was (not!) running, I placed my second recorder in two other consecutive positions, one of which got me a moderately distant recording of the chimes from part-way along the narrow south-running crest of Hunter's Tor. Then, when I considered that time was up for the main recording (which, as I say, had actually not happened!), I took that recorder and placed it on a minor hump that was overlooking the chimes from the north - albeit the chimes actually not being visible from this position owing to various trees and large granite rocks / outcrops. This turned out to get a more 'distant' sound from the chimes than from the actually further-away recorder to the south.\n\nThat would have been great, but there were really quite major interferences. Unlike in my 18th February recordings here, the wind was from the south, and was making traffic on the Moretonhampstead to Whiddon Down road distinctly audible - something I most certainly did not want in any of my recordings. And then, part-way through this recording a confounded cockerel associated with one of the farm cottages down in the woods to the west (the right side in this recording) started crowing.\n\nWhereas the cockerel in my February recordings here was very distant and too quiet to be a problem in the recordings, this one was loud and strident and very definitely a problem. Realistically, I could not cut out all that much traffic noise without having too little recording left - and there was no way that I could sensibly clear out the cockerel, with its frequent and persistent crowings. (I would point out, though, that the main continuous rushing sound in the background is not traffic but the River Teign some distance below.)\n\nThe net outcome of this is that from my perspective this and the other 'distant chimes' recording made here on this day are really not suitable for use in commercially produced CDs, and so for these particular recordings I make an exception to my general rule of only excerpts of my <i>Wind Chimes in the Wild</i> recordings on Freesound, and have uploaded the full recordings. Maybe some people would even enjoy the disturbances - the traffic sounds and that effing cockerel! \n\nThe chimes used are bamboo chimes, large and small set (imprecisely tuned to a semblance of the whole tone scale) and Music of the Spheres Gypsy Chimes, Mezzo and Soprano sizes (tuned to a troubled and melancholy-sounding Eastern European Gypsy scale).\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/recording-chimes-hunters-tor-2013-02-18_06.jpg\">\n<i>My 18th February recording session here. The only difference this time was that the Chimes of Pluto (silvery) were not being used, and I didn't realize that the recorder there was not recording! For this recording the recorder was transferred to the top of a hump in the woods beyond the chimes in this view, overlooking them, but with trees and boulders / outcrops blocking actual visibility.</i>\n\nRecording made with a Sony PCM-M10 on a Velbon mini-tripod, using the built-in microphones covered with a Rode Dead Kitten windshield. I have used Audacity to apply a custom EQ profile to correct for the high frequency muffling caused by the windshield, and also to correct for an audible 'hump' in the lower bass frequencies, which I get in ALL my recordings prior to processing.\n<p><b>Please remember to give this recording a rating! <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\"></b></p>",

        "description": "<b>Extraordinary-sounding Davis Blanchard Pluto wind chimes together with bamboo chimes, high up in the Teign Gorge. A bright rather steely timbre to the Pluto chimes, and the notes tuned in just intonation on a minor scale note sequence incorporating a minor major seventh chord. This therefore contains an intriguing-sounding dissonance. The contrast between the metallic and dry, woody timbres gives each set of chimes a different effect as compared with when it's heard solo.</b>\n\nThis is one of the many fruits of my <i><b>Wind Chimes in the Wild</b></i> project. Perhaps perversely, I'm uploading my recordings in reverse chronological order &#8212; most recent first &#8212;, so the most 'advanced' sounds are tending to come earlier rather than later. \n\n<b><a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-2-windchimes.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Detailed information about the Davis Blanchard chimes</a></b>\n\nI recorded this on 16 February 2017, on the rough slope just below Hunting Gate, which latter marks the highest point of the Hunter's Path, high up on the north side of the Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK.\n\nThe distinctive timbre of all the Davis Blanchard chimes is a result of their being made of <i><b>galvanized steel</b></i> instead of the usual aluminium alloy. They proved so heavy physically that I couldn't sensibly carry more than two sets of these to any session &#8212; i.e., in my rucksack, hitch-hiking out and back, and walking between road and recording spot.\n\nHowever, as each set of DB chimes is 8-note, more than two sets of them would be overkill, creating an unworkably complex mass of pitches when hung up, so I probably wouldn't have gained anything useful by struggling to my recording spot with a third set of those &#8212; though later on I was to add a set of much lighter Woodstock chimes to two of these for some deliciously outlandish effects.\n\n<img alt=\"This recording taking place\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/170216_recording_wind_chimes_high_up_in_teign_gorge.jpg\">\n<i>This recording taking place.</i>\n\n<b>Techie stuff:</b>\n\nThe recorder was a Sony PCM-D100, with two nested furry windshields &#8212; the inner being a Movo one <b>of rectangular box shape*</b>, and the outer a custom Windcut one &#8212;, and it was placed on a full-size Zipshot tripod.\n\n* <i>Note that I <strong>WARN AGAINST</strong> use of windshields that are of any sort of box shape, for I soon found that they were inherently unsuitable for any decent-quality recording. While no doubt non-box-shaped windshields from Movo would be okay, the presence of relatively flat surfaces, edges and corners creates internal narrow resonance peaks in the treble, which give the latter an abrasive and rather 'screamy' quality, no matter who's made the particular windshields.&#160; When I realized why my recordings had developed that nasty treble quality I had to go back through all recordings made with that dratted box-shaped windshield, and use Voxengo CurveEQ to enable me to precisely neutralize two narrow treble peaks and thus enable the recordings to sound wonderfully natural rather than bafflingly stressful.</i> \n\nPost-recording processing was to apply EQ in Audacity to correct for the muffling effect of the windshields &#8212; and then, later on, the aforementioned remedial EQ measure using Voxengo CurveEQ to remove the two narrow treble peaks kindly added by that rogue model of furry windshield.\n\n<b>Please remember to give this recording a rating &#8212; Thank you!</b>&#160; <img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\">",

        "description": "On 28th November 2012 I took out with me a large and a small set of cheap bamboo chimes and two sets of Music of the Spheres Gypsy (quality, metal) wind chimes - the Soprano and Mezzo sizes, the sounds of which latter two mesh together beautifully. My intention was to hang the chimes on the same tree that I had used for my recordings a week earlier, at Sharp Tor, by the Hunter's Path, high up on the north side of the over-steepened part of the River Teign valley known as the Teign Gorge, Devon, UK.\n\nIn the event the wind, being from a north-easterly direction this time, was not sufficiently reaching anywhere along there, and I finally reluctantly went higher up on the slope, almost to the top, where a chilly breeze was coming over and moving the tree branches a bit. I hung the chimes on one tree and made one recording, but after nearly 10 minutes of rather modest activity the wind got up more and then appeared to be too continuously on the strong side, so I then moved to a nearby tree that was not catching the wind so strongly, to make the further recordings, including this one.\n\nBeing this high up was not ideal, for the sound of the River Teign in the valley bottom, although still audible, is heard only indirectly and faintly, so, when listening to the recording, it is difficult to tell what is the nature of the very faint continuous roar in the background. Also, here I was very close to the grazed pasture that covers the broad top of the hill, and a result of this is that all this day's recordings are punctuated by faint moos from distant cattle that were far away and out of sight.\n\nThis recording is of the two sets of bamboo chimes, which I had purchased locally in Exeter for just a few pounds each, plus the Music of the Spheres Gypsy Chimes, Soprano size. The refined ethereal, 'liquid' tone and precise tuning of these metal Music of the Spheres chimes contrast beautifully with the dry, earthy rattlings, clatterings and 'donkings' of the bamboo chimes. Indeed, these Gypsy chimes, with their particular timbre and tuning to some sort of Eastern European scale, sound at a distance like some ghostly organ playing. People who passed by while I was making recordings with these chimes tended spontaneously to use the words 'haunting' and 'magical'.\n\nThis is a 5-minute excerpt from the 29+ minutes full recording.\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/chimes-bamboo-gypsy-mezzo-recording-above-teign-gorge-450x405.jpg\">\n<i>This photo shows my recording studio for 28th November 2012 - almost at the top of the north side of the Teign Gorge, and facing obliquely away from it. The sets of chimes visible are the large and small bamboo, with the Gypsy Mezzo in the middle.\n\nNote that actually this was a first time learning experience for me with the Gypsy chimes, and actually for best effects the Gypsy chimes needed to be about twice the distance from the recorder than I actually used on this particular day, on account of their having a stronger and more penetrating tone than my other chimes.</i>\n\nRecording made with a Sony PCM-M10 on a Hama mini-tripod, using the built-in microphones covered with a Rycote Mini Windjammer. I have used a graphic EQ profile in WavePad to compensate for the slight muffling of the sound caused by the Windjammer.\n\n<b><i>I caution that the wind noise in the microphones is bound to sound too intrusive when this recording is played back through speakers / headphones that are prone to boominess; good quality hi-fi speakers with extended and flat bass response are really needed for any of these recordings really to sound right.</i></b> Please also note that the volume level of this recording has been carefully adjusted for listening purposes, and ALL my recordings so far are meant to be listened to with a volume setting that would give a realistic level for playback of CLASSICAL music (a large but not exceptional symphony orchestra). If you have the right volume setting, you should not need to change that setting from one recording of mine to another.\n\nN.B. Initially I gave all this day's recordings a 3dB cut of the lower bass to somewhat lighten the sound of the wind in the microphones, and so all the excerpts here from this day's recording have that bass reduction.  However, subsequently, on careful listening, especially through my decent hi-fi speakers, I came to the conclusion that the wind noise in the microphones did not reach a level at which such processing was really necessary, and so I have subsequently restored those bass frequencies to the full recordings, with a distinct improvement in the sound as heard through my hi-fi speakers.\n<p><i>(Later note: This recording - with better sound than here - is one of my CD-quality downloads, and can be found in <a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">my e-Store</a>.)</i></p>\n<p><b>Please remember to give this recording a rating! <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\"></b></p>",

        "description": "On 30th January 2013 I took out with me a set of Woodstock Chimes of Pluto and two sets of Music of the Spheres Gypsy wind chimes - the Soprano and Mezzo sizes, the sounds of which latter two mesh together beautifully.\n\nI was aiming for the same recording location as I used for my previous wind chimes recordings - in November 2012 - but this time a very strong wind was blowing over the more exposed parts, and, on the Hunters' Path from Drewsteignton (Devon, UK), high up on the side of the so-called Teign Gorge above Fingle Bridge, as I was coming out of the woods that clothe the steep valley slopes I was suddenly blasted by a wind of about gale force (force 8 on the Beaufort scale), and realized that my previous recording locations here would most likely be too windy this time.\n\nSo, I withdrew very slightly back into the top of the woods, descending slightly to just below the top part of the narrow track that ascends steeply from Fingle Bridge to join the Hunters' Path, and found a suitable group of low tree branches that were sufficiently sheltered to be getting a very nice range of wind strength, from very little indeed up to 'fresh' (force 5 on the Beaufort scale).\n\nThus today was an opportunity to record a gale in the woods, with wind chimes intermingled in the wind sound and indeed quite often buried in it as the most powerful gusts came. The results turned out to be interesting and very much in accordance with what I had been hankering after for as long as I'd been thinking of recording wind chimes. It is important, therefore, to enable yourself to perceive this particular day's recordings NOT as 'failed' or otherwise bad chimes recordings, but as extremely successful gale-in-the-woods recordings complete with wind chimes.\n\nAs well as the wind commotion, actually the River Teign far below was making its own quieter commotion, for it was particularly full after a lot of heavy rain, but during my whole 5+ hours' recording session I could never quite differentiate between the rushing sound of the Teign and the wind.\n\nOne thing you are bound to notice is that the degree of activity of the chimes does not tally all that much with the degree of roaring of the wind in the trees. This is because of my relatively sheltered position, so the big and powerful eddies in the flow of the air as it comes over the hill into the valley go careering through the tree branches above and around me, but the gusts that come to me and the recorder and chimes are almost all NOT those directly but smaller subsidiary eddies that come spinning off the big ones.\n\n<b>It is inevitable that the wind commotion will make particularly fatiguing listening, especially to the full-length recordings, when played through anything other than really good speakers / headphones. Please note that in the full-length recordings made on this day, ALL of them have some awesomely powerful and loud wind gusts that at times virtually drown out the chimes, so any of the excerpts here seeming louder or quieter than others is in fact misleading, as all the full length recordings have very loud and also almost quiet (albeit far from silent!) moments.\n\nPlease note also, that if you watch the waveform image here on Freesound while playing the excerpts you will NOT get the proper effect. The big wind gusts sound immensely more powerful and even frightening when you are NOT watching that, so you never know how much more the sound is going to increase, maybe to blow you and indeed the whole of Existence away! :-)</b>\n\nAnother listening tip - if you have really good and wide stereo separation you will find that the wind sound is not simply a fluctuating roar (really rather boring!), but a wonderful drama of ogreish 'wind monsters' chasing around here, there, and who knows where! The three-dimensional movement really makes an exciting drama of it all.\n\nThis recording is of the Woodstock Chimes of Pluto. Without being combined with chimes tuned to other scales, the radiant, 'happy' quality of the Pluto chimes shines through. \n\nThis is a 5-minute excerpt from the 34 minutes full recording.\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/recording-nr-top-of-woods-above-fingle-bridge.jpg\">\n<i>This photo shows my recording studio for 30th January 2013 - almost at the top of the north side of the Teign Gorge, and facing obliquely over the valley, so that the great gusts of wind come roaring from the right and then go careering round over and down into the valley. The sets of chimes visible are the Gypsy Mezzo (left, and further away) and the Pluto (right).\nNote that the former being further away is not a bit of carelessness of mine, but a quite deliberate placement. I learnt from my first Gypsy Chimes recordings (back in November) that for best results those particular chimes need to be placed further from the microphones than the Woodstock or bamboo chimes (at least, those that I have), on account of their more penetrating and potentially overpowering tone.</i><br>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/track-high-above-fingle-bridge.jpg\">\n<i>Looking the other way from near the top of the track ascending from Fingle Bridge, which latter is hidden way down below. The recorder is about 25 metres behind me, just a little down the slope from this track.</i>\n\nRecording made with a Sony PCM-M10 on a Velbon mini-tripod, using the built-in microphones covered with a Rode Dead Kitten.\n\n<img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/arrow-long-right.gif\"> Please note that all recordings from 5th January to 2nd Feb 2013, inclusive (i.e. including this one) did not receive any correction for high-frequency attenuation caused by the new Rode Dead Kitten windshield. Subsequently I was able to work out a graphic EQ profile to apply to all recordings that used that windshield, and have applied it retrospectively - but I have no plans to go through the hassle of re-uploading here the recordings that originally missed out on that correction.\n\nTherefore, copies of recordings made in that period, including this one, which I supply on CDs or as licensed copies for commercial use, will have better sound quality and will sound clearer, more 'present', and with more precision of detail than what you hear from here.\n\n<b>Please note that only very good speakers / headphones with a very extended and flat frequency response will do this recording real justice, and, as already noted, lesser speakers / headphones would make this sound quite fatiguing to listen to.\n\nPlease also note that the volume level of this recording has been carefully adjusted for listening purposes, and ALL my recordings so far are meant to be listened to with a volume setting that would give a realistic level for playback of CLASSICAL music (a large but not exceptional symphony orchestra). If you have the right volume setting, you should not need to change that setting from one recording of mine to another.</b>\n<p><i>(Later note: This recording - with better sound than here - is one of my CD-quality downloads, and can be found in <a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">my e-Store</a>.)</i></p>\n<p><b>Please remember to give this recording a rating! <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\"></b></p>",

        "description": "Recording made on 14th November 2012 with a Sony PCM-M10 on a Hama mini-tripod, using the built-in microphones covered with a Rycote Mini Windjammer. I have used a graphic EQ profile in WavePad to compensate for the slight muffling of the sound caused by the Windjammer. I also applied a 3dB reduction to low bass frequencies, to render the wind noise in the microphones a bit less 'heavy'.\n\nOn 14th November 2012 I took out with me three sets of Woodstock wind chimes, with the intent to record about 20 minutes of each solo, and a full half-hour of each of the four possible combinations of these. Because of the likely interruptions through people passing by along the track, plus intrusions from aeroplanes, I aimed to record for longer than the target duration each time, to allow for cutting bits out - as indeed I had to quite a lot. I hung the chimes on small low branches of a particular well situated stunted tree by the Hunter's Path overlooking the over-steepened valley (popularly known as the Teign Gorge, though it is not actually a gorge) in the vicinity of Sharp Tor, very near Castle Drogo.  There is thus a constant quiet background of rushing water far below.\n\nThis recording is of the tenor-pitched Gregorian Chimes together with the similarly tenor pitched Chimes of Olympos. The Gregorian chimes are tuned to a Gregorian chant scale, while the Chimes of Olympos are tuned to a melancholy sounding Ancient Greek pentatonic scale, and thus there is an intriguing interaction between the two sound worlds, which helps to keep one's attention rather than send one to sleep. \n\nTo my ears this particular combination of the chimes is greatly beautiful and moving, though I have to save my actual superlatives for the combination of these two with the Chimes of Pluto, which I recorded also.\n\nThis is a 5-minute excerpt from the 36+ minutes full recording.\n\nThe photo below is of the actual tree used for this recording, with the recorder on the mini-tripod just visible rather awkwardly astride the base of a branch. The photo actually shows the setup for the previous week's recording of the Pluto chimes, and the setup for this recording differs only in that I had the chimes on branches directly overlooking the valley slope (i.e. on the left in this view), and the recorder was in the same position except, unsurprisingly, pointing across the valley (i.e. again, to the left in this view).\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/chimes-pluto-hunters-path-299x355.jpg\">\n\nPlease note that the volume level of this recording has been carefully adjusted for listening purposes, and ALL my recordings so far are meant to be listened to with a volume setting that would give a realistic level for playback of CLASSICAL music (a large but not exceptional symphony orchestra).

As with other ensembles in this series of Davis Blanchard chimes, the pairing of the particular chimes can sound initially discordant, but then that sense of discord rapidly dissipates as a cornucopia of wonderful musical interactions between the chimes unfolds.

I hung the chimes on small low branches of a particular well situated stunted tree at Sharp Tor just by the Hunter's Path, which overlooks the over-steepened valley (popularly known as the Teign Gorge, though it is not actually a gorge) very near Castle Drogo.

They both have rather imprecise tuning, but nonetheless, the large set gives some semblance of a whole tone scale (which is bound to sound interesting when used together with other chimes), and the small set, although seeming more indeterminate in its tuning, adds in a tritone and other 'interesting' intervals to the range of the large set. I have chosen always to use both sets of bamboo chimes together. This combination has an interesting and 'earthy' sort of sound, which, to my ears sounds nice 'as is', but also gives really interesting effects in combination with some of my metal chimes, which I myself at least find really beautiful. In this recording they are sounding only more or less quietly, for the wind had not yet got up to optimal level.\n\nThis is a 5-minute excerpt from the 13+ minutes full recording.\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/chimes-gregorian-pluto-recording-sharptor-drogo-500x375.jpg\">\nThis photo shows my recording studio for 21st November 2012 - on Sharp Tor, high up on the north side of the Teign Gorge.

        "description": "On 30th January 2013 I took out with me a set of Woodstock Chimes of Pluto and two sets of Music of the Spheres Gypsy wind chimes - the Soprano and Mezzo sizes, the sounds of which latter two mesh together beautifully.\n\nI was aiming for the same recording location as I used for my previous wind chimes recordings - in November 2012 - but this time a very strong wind was blowing over the more exposed parts, and, on the Hunters' Path from Drewsteignton (Devon, UK), high up on the side of the so-called Teign Gorge above Fingle Bridge, as I was coming out of the woods that clothe the steep valley slopes I was suddenly blasted by a wind of about gale force (force 8 on the Beaufort scale), and realized that my previous recording locations here would most likely be too windy this time.\n\nSo, I withdrew very slightly back into the top of the woods, descending slightly to just below the top part of the narrow track that ascends steeply from Fingle Bridge to join the Hunters' Path, and found a suitable group of low tree branches that were sufficiently sheltered to be getting a very nice range of wind strength, from very little indeed up to 'fresh' (force 5 on the Beaufort scale).\n\nThus today was an opportunity to record a gale in the woods, with wind chimes intermingled in the wind sound and indeed quite often buried in it as the most powerful gusts came. The results turned out to be interesting and very much in accordance with what I had been hankering after for as long as I'd been thinking of recording wind chimes. It is important, therefore, to enable yourself to perceive this particular day's recordings NOT as 'failed' or otherwise bad chimes recordings, but as extremely successful gale-in-the-woods recordings complete with wind chimes.\n\nAs well as the wind commotion, actually the River Teign far below was making its own quieter commotion, for it was particularly full after a lot of heavy rain, but during my whole 5+ hours' recording session I could never quite differentiate between the rushing sound of the Teign and the wind.\n\nOne thing you are bound to notice is that the degree of activity of the chimes does not tally all that much with the degree of roaring of the wind in the trees. This is because of my relatively sheltered position, so the big and powerful eddies in the flow of the air as it comes over the hill into the valley go careering through the tree branches above and around me, but the gusts that come to me and the recorder and chimes are almost all NOT those directly but smaller subsidiary eddies that come spinning off the big ones.\n\n<b>It is inevitable that the wind commotion will make particularly fatiguing listening, especially to the full-length recordings, when played through anything other than really good speakers / headphones. Please note that in the full-length recordings made on this day, ALL of them have some awesomely powerful and loud wind gusts that at times virtually drown out the chimes, so any of the excerpts here seeming louder or quieter than others is in fact misleading, as all the full length recordings have very loud and also almost quiet (albeit far from silent!) moments.\n\nPlease note also, that if you watch the waveform image here on Freesound while playing the excerpts you will NOT get the proper effect. The big wind gusts sound immensely more powerful and even frightening when you are NOT watching that, so you never know how much more the sound is going to increase, maybe to blow you and indeed the whole of Existence away! :-)</b>\n\nAnother listening tip - if you have really good and wide stereo separation you will find that the wind sound is not simply a fluctuating roar (really rather boring!), but a wonderful drama of ogreish 'wind monsters' chasing around here, there, and who knows where! The three-dimensional movement really makes an exciting drama of it all.\n\nThis recording is of the Music of the Spheres Gypsy Mezzo chimes. Without being combined with chimes tuned to other scales, the weird, emotionally intense quality of these chimes is able to sing out, with the distinctive doleful sound of the Gypsy chimes of this larger size. \n\nThis is a 5-minute excerpt from the 30+ minutes full recording.\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/recording-nr-top-of-woods-above-fingle-bridge.jpg\">\n<i>This photo shows my recording studio for 30th January 2013 - almost at the top of the north side of the Teign Gorge, and facing obliquely over the valley, so that the great gusts of wind come roaring from the right and then go careering round over and down into the valley. The sets of chimes visible are the Gypsy Mezzo (left, and further away) and the Pluto (right).\nNote that the former being further away is not a bit of carelessness of mine, but a quite deliberate placement. I learnt from my first Gypsy Chimes recordings (back in November) that for best results those particular chimes need to be placed further from the microphones than the Woodstock or bamboo chimes (at least, those that I have), on account of their more penetrating and potentially overpowering tone.</i><br>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/track-high-above-fingle-bridge.jpg\">\n<i>Looking the other way from near the top of the track ascending from Fingle Bridge, which latter is hidden way down below. The recorder is about 25 metres behind me, just a little down the slope from this track.</i>\n\nRecording made with a Sony PCM-M10 on a Velbon mini-tripod, using the built-in microphones covered with a Rode Dead Kitten.\n\n<img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/arrow-long-right.gif\"> Please note that all recordings from 5th January to 2nd Feb 2013, inclusive (i.e. including this one) did not receive any correction for high-frequency attenuation caused by the new Rode Dead Kitten windshield. Subsequently I was able to work out a graphic EQ profile to apply to all recordings that used that windshield, and have applied it retrospectively - but I have no plans to go through the hassle of re-uploading here the recordings that originally missed out on that correction.\n\nTherefore, copies of recordings made in that period, including this one, which I supply on CDs or as licensed copies for commercial use, will have better sound quality and will sound clearer, more 'present', and with more precision of detail than what you hear from here.\n\n<b>Please note that only very good speakers / headphones with a very extended and flat frequency response will do this recording real justice, and, as already noted, lesser speakers / headphones would make this sound quite fatiguing to listen to.\n\nPlease also note that the volume level of this recording has been carefully adjusted for listening purposes, and ALL my recordings so far are meant to be listened to with a volume setting that would give a realistic level for playback of CLASSICAL music (a large but not exceptional symphony orchestra). If you have the right volume setting, you should not need to change that setting from one recording of mine to another.</b>\n<p><i>(Later note: This recording - with better sound than here - is one of my CD-quality downloads, and can be found in <a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">my e-Store</a>.)</i></p>\n<p><b>Please remember to give this recording a rating! <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\"></b></p>",

        "description": "Recording made on 14th November 2012 with a Sony PCM-M10 on a Hama mini-tripod, using the built-in microphones covered with a Rycote Mini Windjammer. I have used a graphic EQ profile in WavePad to compensate for the slight muffling of the sound caused by the Windjammer. I also applied a 3dB reduction to low bass frequencies, to render the wind noise in the microphones a bit less 'heavy'.\n\nOn 14th November 2012 I took out with me three sets of Woodstock wind chimes, with the intent to record about 20 minutes of each solo, and a full half-hour of each of the four possible combinations of these. Because of the likely interruptions through people passing by along the track, plus intrusions from aeroplanes, I aimed to record for longer than the target duration each time, to allow for cutting bits out - as indeed I had to quite a lot. I hung the chimes on small low branches of a particular well situated stunted tree by the Hunter's Path overlooking the over-steepened valley (popularly known as the Teign Gorge, though it is not actually a gorge) in the vicinity of Sharp Tor, very near Castle Drogo. There is thus a constant quiet background of rushing water far below.\n\nThis recording is of the tenor-pitched Gregorian Chimes together with the smaller and thus higher-pitched Chimes of Pluto; it was intended to be a full half-hour, but after a few minutes I decided I wanted to start again with a different spatial arrangement of the two sets of chimes, and so I did indeed restart, so I have this odd short quiet recording as an 'extra'. The Gregorian chimes are tuned to a Gregorian chant scale, while the Pluto chimes are tuned to a very sweet sounding pentatonic scale, and thus there is an intriguing interaction between the two sound worlds, which helps to keep one's attention rather than send one to sleep. \n\nAs this is a short recording, I'm presenting it here in full.\n\nThe photo below is of the actual tree used for this recording, with the recorder on the mini-tripod just visible rather awkwardly astride the base of a branch. The photo actually shows the setup for the previous week's recording of the Pluto chimes, and the setup for this recording differs only in that I had the chimes on branches directly overlooking the valley slope (i.e. on the left in this view), and the recorder was in the same position except, unsurprisingly, pointing across the valley (i.e. again, to the left in this view).\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/chimes-pluto-hunters-path-299x355.jpg\">\n\nPlease note that the volume level of this recording has been carefully adjusted for listening purposes, and ALL my recordings so far are meant to be listened to with a volume setting that would give a realistic level for playback of CLASSICAL music (a large but not exceptional symphony orchestra).

        "description": "This is the first and longer of two additional recordings made with a second recorder, while my two consecutive 'main' chimes recordings were taking place at this spot.\n\nOn 5th March 2013 I took out with me a large and a small set of cheap bamboo chimes and three sets of quality metal wind chimes, to my regular field recording location for wind chimes - the Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK. \n\nOn this occasion, for the first hour of my walk-in from Drewsteignton, I was greeted by unexpected lack of wind altogether. Fine for recording birds, but not for the chimes! Then, rather resigning myself to recording birds-only, and to my chimes being just a tiresome dead-weight, out on the long mostly open and relatively level stretch of the Hunter's Path, high up on the north side of the steep sided valley, I noticed a particular nicely situated stunted oak tree that seemed to be beckoning me, pointing out to me that it had a nice arrangement of suitable branches, which would enable me to get the right balance between the different sets of chimes\n\nAll very well, but of course just for noting to use another time, for right now I'd look silly trying to record chimes with no wind! - Well, except that just that moment breaths of wind started coming on, just enough to make twigs move. And so it was that I set up here, with the wind gradually getting up and actually giving me a lovely performance from the chimes after all.\n\nThere was more than one fly in the ointment, however, for a whole succession of mostly high-altitude aeroplanes came over, so I had to cut out quite a number of bits in this recording, and still there are some brief bits of very distant aeroplane sound in the edited recording - and also, there must have been a tractor at work in the field that tops the hill on this side, for I could hear a quiet sort-of nag-nag-nagging of very low frequency motor noise, which could not sensibly all be removed from the recordings. Despite that, though, I ended up with four very beautiful recordings from this spot - two 'main' chimes recordings, and then two natural soundscape recordings with the chimes at a distance.\n\nAs already noted, this is the first and longer of the two 'distant' recordings, and for this I used a Joby GorillaPod to seat the recorder on a tree branch on the other (uphill) side of the Hunter's Path, just a little further along, so probably about 25 metres from the 'main' chimes recorder position. It is thus a particularly quiet recording, and it would be a mistake to turn the volume up for this. I left this recording running when I took down the Pluto chimes for the second 'main' recording, and because that meant an intrusive disturbance in this recording, I chose, rather than break this recording into two, to simply cut out the disturbance.\n\nSo, part-way through, the tone of the chimes 'mysteriously' changes once the Pluto chimes are removed from the mix. You then hear just how intensely mysterious and melancholy the Gypsy chimes sound at a distance.\n\nThe chimes used are bamboo chimes, large and small set (imprecisely tuned to a semblance of the whole tone scale), Woodstock Chimes of Pluto (tuned to a radiant 'happy' pentatonic scale), and Music of the Spheres Gypsy Chimes, Mezzo and Soprano sizes (tuned to a troubled and melancholy-sounding Eastern European Gypsy scale). The combination of the metal chimes sounds remarkably different from either on their own, and is very beautiful indeed.\n\nAs for the birds in this recording, I'm unable to name them all (as yet), though chaffinch, skylark, raven, pheasant and many others did figure. However, they sang less and less during my session at this position, so, rather late in the recording session, I then moved this recorder to a still more distant position further along the path (probably some 40-50 metres away) for the second and much shorter 'distant' recording.\n\nThis is a 5-minute excerpt from the full 30 minutes' recording.\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/recording-chimes-by-mid-hunters-path.jpg\">\n<i>This photo shows the second of the 'main' recordings taking place. Note the placement of the Gypsy chimes distinctly further back than the bamboo chimes, and the recorder fairly well back from them all in order to get a good balance.</i>\n\nRecording made with a Sony PCM-M10 on a Joby GorillaPod, using the built-in microphones covered with a Rode Dead Kitten windshield. I have used Audacity to apply a custom EQ profile to correct for the high frequency muffling caused by the windshield, and also to correct for an audible 'hump' in the lower bass frequencies, which I get in ALL my recordings prior to processing.\n\n<i>(Later note: This recording - with better sound than here - is one of my CD-quality downloads, and can be found in <a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">my e-Store</a>.)</i>\n<p><b>Please remember to give this recording a rating! <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\"></b></p>",

        "description": "On 28th November 2012 I took out with me a large and a small set of cheap bamboo chimes and two sets of Music of the Spheres Gypsy (quality, metal) wind chimes - the Soprano and Mezzo sizes, the sounds of which latter two mesh together beautifully. My intention was to hang the chimes on the same tree that I had used for my recordings a week earlier, at Sharp Tor, by the Hunter's Path, high up on the north side of the over-steepened part of the River Teign valley known as the Teign Gorge, Devon, UK.\n\nIn the event the wind, being from a north-easterly direction this time, was not sufficiently reaching anywhere along there, and I finally reluctantly went higher up on the slope, almost to the top, where a chilly breeze was coming over and moving the tree branches a bit. I hung the chimes on one tree and made one recording, but after nearly 10 minutes of rather modest activity the wind got up more and then appeared to be too continuously on the strong side, so I then moved to a nearby tree that was not catching the wind so strongly, to make the further recordings, including this one.\n\nBeing this high up was not ideal, for the sound of the River Teign in the valley bottom, although still audible, is heard only indirectly and faintly, so, when listening to the recording, it is difficult to tell what is the nature of the very faint continuous roar in the background. Also, here I was very close to the grazed pasture that covers the broad top of the hill, and a result of this is that all this day's recordings are punctuated by faint moos from distant cattle that were far away and out of sight.\n\nThis recording is of the two sets of bamboo chimes, which I had purchased locally in Exeter for just a few pounds each, plus the Music of the Spheres Gypsy Chimes, Mezzo size. The refined ethereal, 'liquid' tone and precise tuning of these metal Music of the Spheres chimes, together with the rather ponderous sounding of this size of chime, contrast beautifully with the often frenetic dry, earthy rattlings, clatterings and 'donkings' of the bamboo chimes. Indeed, these Gypsy chimes, with their particular timbre and tuning to some sort of Eastern European scale, sound at a distance like some ghostly organ playing. People who passed by while I was making recordings with these chimes tended spontaneously to use the words 'haunting' and 'magical'.\n\nThis is a 5-minute excerpt from the 27+ minutes full recording. It includes a moment of some sort of nature drama. During a period of little wind and therefore quiet and hesitant mysterious soundings from the chimes, there is a sudden 'startle' call from a blackbird, followed by some sort of scuffle among the dead leaves close by - and then suddenly the scuffle erupts and up fly two male blackbirds, with another 'startle' call. One perches in the tree, very close, while the other perches a little way away, and then for about a minute they are both giving their sharp staccato \"Take - Take - Take...!\" warning calls, until the next main gust of wind comes along and shifts the focus to the chimes again. I make a speculative guess that the two blackbirds may have been 'mobbing' a predator that had caught a bird - I have seen such behaviour on the green outside my flat in Exeter. On the other hand it may have been just a territorial dispute (i.e. brawl) between two competing males.\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/chimes-bamboo-gypsy-mezzo-recording-above-teign-gorge-450x405.jpg\">\n<i>This photo shows my recording studio for 28th November 2012 - almost at the top of the north side of the Teign Gorge, and facing obliquely away from it. The sets of chimes visible are the large and small bamboo, with the Gypsy Mezzo in the middle.\nNote that actually this was a first time learning experience for me with the Gypsy chimes, and actually for best effects the Gypsy chimes needed to be about twice the distance from the recorder than I actually used on this particular day, on account of their having a stronger and more penetrating tone than my other chimes.</i>\n\nRecording made with a Sony PCM-M10 on a Hama mini-tripod, using the built-in microphones covered with a Rycote Mini Windjammer. I have used a graphic EQ profile in WavePad to compensate for the slight muffling of the sound caused by the Windjammer.\n<b><i>I caution that the wind noise in the microphones is bound to sound too intrusive when this recording is played back through speakers / headphones that are prone to boominess; good quality hi-fi speakers with extended and flat bass response are really needed for any of these recordings really to sound right.</i></b> Please also note that the volume level of this recording has been carefully adjusted for listening purposes, and ALL my recordings so far are meant to be listened to with a volume setting that would give a realistic level for playback of CLASSICAL music (a large but not exceptional symphony orchestra). If you have the right volume setting, you should not need to change that setting from one recording of mine to another.\n\nN.B. Initially I gave all this day's recordings a 3dB cut of the lower bass to somewhat lighten the sound of the wind in the microphones, and so all the excerpts here from this day's recording have that bass reduction.  However, subsequently, on careful listening, especially through my decent hi-fi speakers, I came to the conclusion that the wind noise in the microphones did not reach a level at which such processing was really necessary, and so I have subsequently restored those bass frequencies to the full recordings, with a distinct improvement in the sound as heard through my hi-fi speakers.\n<p><i>(Later note: This recording - with better sound than here - is one of my CD-quality downloads, and can be found in <a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">my e-Store</a>.)</i></p>\n<p><b>Please remember to give this recording a rating! <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\"></b></p>",

As with other ensembles in this series of Davis Blanchard chimes, the pairing of the particular chimes can sound initially discordant, but then that sense of discord rapidly dissipates as a cornucopia of wonderful musical interactions between the chimes unfolds. There is something in the haunting overall sound that seems to be telling a story of some urgency.</b>\n\n<b>Chimes used:</b>\n\n<b>1. Davis Blanchard Pluto</b> (left)\n\n<b>2.

        "description": "<b>Tumultuously wild and exhilarating! A wind chimes ensemble in a gale, in the western end of Drewston Woods, just below the Hunter's Path, high up in the Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK. We're sheltered from most of the wind, but gale-force gusts come over the top of the hill, chasing and roaring through the treetops and giving us an interesting time!</b>\n\n<b>Chimes used:</b>\n\n<b>1. Music of the Spheres Gypsy Chimes, Soprano</b> (Eastern European Gypsy scale, higher)\n\n<b>2. Music of the Spheres Gypsy Chimes, Mezzo</b> (Ditto, lower)\n\n<b>3. Woodstock Chimes of Pluto</b> (Pentatonic, with a rather 'major' sound)\n\nI made this recording on 30 January 2013, with a gale blowing. Amazingly, when I came out of the Drewston Woods and found myself being beaten back into the woods by the gale, after a few minutes of dithering, wondering what to do, I decided <i>not to go ahead with this session!</i> The point was, that I was thinking only of recording the chimes, and realized that the chimes sound would repeatedly get lost in the tremendous roar of the stronger gusts. \n\nIt was then that I used what I nowadays call <i><b><a href=\"https://clarity-of-being.org/glossary.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Helpfulness Testing</a></b></i> <i>(do a text search for that term on that page)</i> to get an intimation from my own deeper aspects of consciousness as to what my best choice would really be at that point &#8212; whether to abandon the session, to record anyway despite the gale trashing it all, or to do something else altogether. My indication then was clearly to record there anyway.\n\nSo, reluctantly I set up the recorder and started recording, repeatedly thinking <i>No, no! This is a waste of time with all this din!</i> &#8212; But then, over about 10 minutes it progressively dawned on me: I'd been wanting to record a gale in the woods all along! Silly, funny me! This was not a chimes recording being trashed by the wind, but a wonderful gale recording with the chimes as a bonus! &#8212; And so from then on I was electrifyingly elated at my wonderful privilege to have got these conditions and now to be recording chimes in a gale or, a gale with chimes, whichever way one cares to look at it! \u2014 And of course I could include a recording of the gale without chimes too, which indeed I did.\n\nThe only downer about this became apparent years later, when I used software to sharpen and widen all my PCM-M10 recordings because of that recorder model's atrocious stereo imaging. To some extent the wind sound in these recordings &#8212; most notably the recording of the wind without chimes &#8212; suffered in the same way that any wide expanse of hissy sea sound did, sounding rather to very phasey and having distinct phase cancellation spots in the soundstage when listened to through speakers (though still excellent when heard through headphones). Anyway, that issue seems not to notice so much in the recordings with chimes, and this one is a case in point.\n\n\n<img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/130206-130130_recording_wind_chimes_in_woods_above_fingle_bridge_03.jpg\" alt=\"The recording location\">\n<i>This recording taking place. The wind was coming over the top of the hill, i.e., from the right and a little behind in this view.</i>\n\n<b>Techie stuff:</b>\n\nThe recorder was Sony PCM-M10, with R&#248;de DeadKitten furry windshield (original, more effective, version). It was set up on a Velbon Mini tripod.\n\nPost-recording processing was to apply EQ in Audacity to correct for the muffling effect of the windshield &#8212; and then more recently stereo widening / sharpening-up using the VST plugin A1 Stereo Control (160% widening).\n\n<b>Please remember to give this recording a rating &#8212; Thank you!</b>&#160; <img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\">",

        "description": "On 21st November 2012 I took out with me a large and a small set of cheap bamboo chimes and two sets of Woodstock (quality, metal) wind chimes. I hung the chimes on small low branches of a particular well situated stunted tree at Sharp Tor just by the Hunter's Path, which overlooks the over-steepened valley (popularly known as the Teign Gorge, though it is not actually a gorge) very near Castle Drogo. In reality the rocky crag rather blocks off the view and most direct sound from the River Teign at the bottom of the valley, and at this spot it was necessary for me to have the recorder facing the other way, back towards the Hunter's Path.\n\nThe background sound of the River Teign was actually quite a bit louder on this day than it would normally be, because there had been an exceptional overnight rainfall, which had caused quite widespread local flooding events, and thus today the rivers were all very full.\n\nThis recording is of the two sets of bamboo chimes, which I had purchased locally in Exeter for just a few pounds each, plus the Woodstock Gregorian Chimes. The bamboo chimes both have rather imprecise tuning, but nonetheless, the large set gives some semblance of a whole tone scale (which is bound to sound interesting when used together with other chimes), and the small set, although seeming more indeterminate in its tuning, adds in a tritone and other 'interesting' intervals to the range of the large set. I have chosen always to use both sets of bamboo chimes together. This combination has an interesting and 'earthy' sort of sound, which, to my ears sounds nice 'as is', but also gives really interesting effects in combination with some of my metal chimes, which I myself at least find really beautiful.\n\nThe Gregorian Chimes are the tenor version, precision tuned to a Gregorian chant scale, and their refined ethereal, 'liquid' tone and precise tuning contrast beautifully with the dry, earthy rattlings, clatterings and 'donkings' of the bamboo chimes.\n\nThis is a 5-minute excerpt from the 37+ minutes full recording.\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/chimes-gregorian-pluto-recording-sharptor-drogo-500x375.jpg\">\nThis photo shows my recording studio for 21st November 2012 - on Sharp Tor, high up on the north side of the Teign Gorge.

        "description": "On 6th February 2013 I took out with me to the Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK, a set of Woodstock Gregorian Tenor Chimes and two sets of Music of the Spheres Gypsy wind chimes. I was aiming for another full day's recording near the top of the woods above Fingle Bridge - and indeed I did last out for a full morning there - but then I had to pack up and flee because the air temperature was only about 4 degrees, with some wind-chill factor as well, and my hands and feet were causing me stress through being so painfully cold.\n\nI thought that I'd finished recording for the day, but got down to the much more sheltered Fisherman's Path by the River Teign at the west end of the steep-sided part of the valley, turning back downstream along that path just a little, and it was sufficiently sheltered and sunny just by the very noisy Drogo Weir (with fish ladder) for me to sit on a wooden seat there and at last eat my packed lunch - my hands having warmed up by then.\n\nThen I started noticing that actually some modest gusts of wind were coming from the west along the very bottom of the valley here (the general wind direction being northerly), and so as soon as I'd finished eating I tried experimentally putting up and recording a set of chimes in a sequence of different positions beside the river just a little downstream from the weir (an even moderately close recording of the latter itself would have been too noisy for a pleasant 'listenable' recording).\n\n<img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/teign-weir-130218.jpg\">\n<i>Drogo Weir, photographed a couple of weeks later, with probably less than half the flow than was occurring for the current recording.</i>\n\nThis, then, and the other recordings in this particular sequence, was very much of an experiment, with a quite loud river noise and the chimes sound tending to be buried within the river sound except when wind gusts came along and made the chimes more frisky. This recording, and its other 'siblings' taken at this location, then, needs to be perceived NOT a failed chimes recording, but a recording of the river sound with chimes in the midst of it.\n\nGenerally I would want quieter river sound against the chimes, but actually I had little choice here, because when I sought to get just slightly up the slope, a little more removed from the river, I lost the wind, and so could not use the chimes there anyway. But in any case this was an interesting experiment, and I could come back here another time with more favourable wind conditions and get a more restful balance of river and chimes.\n\nThe chimes in this recording are the Woodstock Gregorian Tenor Chimes, tuned to a Gregorian chant scale, which gives them a bright and 'grand' sound.\n\nThis is a 5-minute excerpt from the 15+ minutes full recording.\n\nRecording made with a Sony PCM-M10 on a Velbon mini-tripod, using the built-in microphones covered with a Rode Dead Kitten windshield. I have used Audacity to apply a custom EQ profile to correct for the high frequency muffling caused by the windshield.\n\n<b>Please note that only very good speakers / headphones with a very extended and flat frequency response will do this recording real justice.  Please also note that the volume level of this recording has been carefully adjusted for listening purposes, and ALL my recordings so far are meant to be listened to with a volume setting that would give a realistic level for playback of CLASSICAL music (a large but not exceptional symphony orchestra).

        "description": "Recording made on 6th November 2012 with a Sony PCM-M10 on a Hama mini-tripod, using the built-in microphones covered with a Rycote Mini Windjammer. I have used a graphic EQ profile in WavePad to compensate for the slight muffling of the sound caused by the Windjammer.\n\nMy three wind chimes recordings made on this particular day mark the beginning of a new project of mine, which I provisionally call <b><i>Wind Chimes In the Wild</i></b>, to produce a collection of truly authentic recordings of a range of quality wind chimes out in Nature, where 'the elements' are an important aspect of each recording. I was moved to point myself towards this project because of the sheer awfulness of all the commercial wind chimes recordings that I'd bought or otherwise heard.\n\nThe problem was usually not the chimes themselves, but the sheer laziness and contempt for the listener of whoever recorded / produced those recordings, which turned out ALL to be faked in various ways - either being just repeating loops of a very short recording, or jiggled mechanically and not by any wind, as shown by regularly repeating patterns in the waveform (and far too consistent a sound level), and any wind or other natural sounds clearly just dubbed on, with no relationship between wind strength variations and the chimes activity.\n\nThe only decent wind chimes recordings that I'd found were a small number on Freesound, and they include some really beautiful ones. So, I decided to help fill the gap left by the lazy and profiteering commercial producers of wind chimes recordings, and make real 'in the wild' wind chimes recordings, with full authenticity, including even wind noise in the microphones at times.\n\nThe latter, although for many purposes regarded as undesirable, actually enhances my recordings - at least provided it doesn't get really disruptively loud. After all, if you're out in the wind you do get the wind rumbling, booming and drumming in your ears, and really it's a nuisance only when it gets really strong and gets drowning out what you actually mean to be listening to out there.\n\nOn 6th November 2012 I took out with me three sets of Woodstock wind chimes, with the intent to record some 10 minutes of each solo, and a full half-hour of each of the four possible combinations of these. In the event conditions enabled me to get only three recordings. I hung the chimes on small low branches of stunted trees by the Hunter's Path overlooking the over-steepened valley (popularly known as the Teign Gorge, though it is not actually a gorge) in the vicinity of Sharp Tor, very near Drogo Castle.\n\nThis recording is of the tenor-pitched Gregorian Chimes together with the smaller and thus higher-pitched Chimes of Pluto. The Gregorian chimes are tuned to a Gregorian chant scale, while the Pluto chimes are tuned to a very sweet sounding pentatonic scale (actually a bit sweeter than I prefer!), and thus there is an intriguing interaction between the two sound worlds, which helps to keep one's attention rather than send one to sleep. I hung them on low branches of a stunted tree very slightly off the track, where a rock crag jutted out over the very steep slope to the valley bottom.\n\nHowever, I could not workably put the chimes actually on top of the crag because of lack of trees just there, so the situation of this recording is a bit odd, for the recorder is actually pointing more or less back towards the track, facing away from the valley slope, and, in this case, placed on the ground, pointing up at about 45 degrees at the chimes, with the crag's hunk of rock behind the recorder and blocking direct sound from the River Teign far below in the bottom of the valley. However, you still hear the sound indirectly, as a distinct continuous rushing, which is neither wind nor traffic.\n\nI made this recording with the recorder on the ground rather than the more 'intuitive' position on a prominence on the crag, because I was concerned that the recording I'd just made with the Olympos and Pluto chimes might be spoiled by too much wind noise in the microphones, and I thought there might be less of that with this different placement. In the end it turned out that this recording got very little wind noise at all in the microphones - and, ironically, I find that the other recording comes out better because of its wind noise in the microphones, which to me was 'just right'.\n\nActually, for some people wind in the microphones would be more or less troublesome anyway, simply because it works well only with listening equipment that has a reasonably flat and well extended bass response. Any tendency to boominess, or indeed a significant deficiency in very low frequency response (as would be the case in virtually all computer speakers) would make that wind noise more problematical.\n\nThis excerpt from the 14+ minutes full recording is the opening five minutes. For some reason, as with the other two recordings I made on that day, there is a fair bit more 'action' and indeed at times boisterousness after the first five minutes - which works out quite satisfyingly when listening to the full recordings.\n\nPlease note that the volume level of this recording has been carefully adjusted for listening purposes, and ALL my recordings so far are meant to be listened to with a volume setting that would give a realistic level for playback of CLASSICAL music (a large but not exceptional symphony orchestra). If you have the right volume setting, you should not need to change that setting from one recording of mine to another.\n<p><b>Please remember to give this recording a rating! <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\"></b></p>",

        "description": "On 5th March 2013 I took out with me a large and a small set of cheap bamboo chimes and three sets of quality metal wind chimes, to my regular field recording location for wind chimes - the Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK. On this occasion, for the first hour of my walk-in from Drewsteignton, I was greeted by unexpected lack of wind altogether. Fine for recording birds, but not for the chimes!\n\nThen, rather resigning myself to recording birds-only, and to my chimes being just a tiresome dead-weight, out on the long mostly open and relatively level stretch of the Hunter's Path, high up on the north side of the steep sided valley, I noticed a particular nicely situated stunted oak tree that seemed to be beckoning me, pointing out to me that it had a nice arrangement of suitable branches, which would enable me to get the right balance between the different sets of chimes.\n\nAll very well, of course, and for noting to use another time, but, of course, no wind! - Well, except that just that moment breaths of wind started coming on, just enough to make twigs move. And so it was that I set up here, with the wind gradually getting up and actually giving me a fine and particularly beautiful performance from the chimes after all.\n\nThere was more than one fly in the ointment, however, for a whole succession of mostly high-altitude aeroplanes came over, so I had to cut out quite a number of bits in this recording, and still there are some brief bits of very distant aeroplane sound in the edited recording - and also, there must have been a tractor at work in the field that tops the hill on this side, for I could hear a quiet sort-of nag-nag-nagging of very low frequency motor noise.\n\nThat affected primarily the previous recording, but is also in this recording, primarily in the opening few minutes. Once I had cut the most badly affected bits out I chose to draw a line and just accept all the sounds that were still 'in' as part of the particular countryside soundscape.\n\nThe chimes used are bamboo chimes, large and small set (imprecisely tuned to a semblance of the whole tone scale) and Music of the Spheres Gypsy Chimes, Mezzo and Soprano sizes (tuned to a troubled and melancholy-sounding Eastern European Gypsy scale).\n\nAs for the birds in this recording, I am unable to name them all (as yet), and in any case they sang less and less during my session at this position, so I was glad to move on presently for recording lower down, where a reasonable number of birds were still singing.\n\nThis is a 5-minute excerpt from the 29+ minutes' recording.\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/recording-chimes-by-mid-hunters-path.jpg\">\n<i>This photo shows this recording taking place. Note the placement of the Gypsy chimes distinctly further back than the bamboo chimes, and the recorder fairly well back from them all in order to get a good balance.</i>\n\nRecording made with a Sony PCM-M10 on a Velbon mini-tripod, using the built-in microphones covered with a Rode Dead Kitten windshield. I have used Audacity to apply a custom EQ profile to correct for the high frequency muffling caused by the windshield, and also to correct for an audible 'hump' in the lower bass frequencies, which I get in ALL my recordings prior to processing.\n<p><i>(Later note: This recording - with better sound than here - is one of my CD-quality downloads, and can be found in <a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">my e-Store</a>.)</i></p>\n<p><b>Please remember to give this recording a rating! <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\"></b></p>",

Half-speed version of part of a recording of <a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/Philip_Goddard/sounds/691834/\" rel=\"nofollow\">a 'Wow!' wind chimes ensemble hung up from trees high up in the Teign Gorge</a> &#8212; but how come it's so emotionally loaded? &#8212; See further below for some comment. Chimes used this time are:</b>\n\n<b>1. Woodstock Gregorian Chimes (Tenor)</b> (relatively low-pitched, a Gregorian chant scale)\n\n<b>2. Woodstock Chimes of Pluto</b> (moderately high-pitched, pentatonic)\n\n<b>3. Woodstock Chimes of Polaris</b> (higher-pitched, pentatonic)\n\n<b>4. Woodstock Chimes of Mercury</b> (very high-pitched pentatonic)\n\n<b>5. Woodstock Chimes of Mars</b> (very high-pitched and penetrating; not sure what scale!)\n\nI recorded this on 19 March 2014, on the rough slope just below Hunting Gate, which latter marks the highest point of the Hunter's Path, high up on the north side of the Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK.\n\nThis half-speed version has a dramatically changed quality, with the Gregorian chimes somehow doing what the Olympos chimes did in ensemble with the same smaller chimes. At this speed the seemingly pretentious bright and sunny sound of the Gregorian is lost in an intense melancholy! Also, the Gregorian tone, with its vibrato, adds a sweetness to the sound-world that feels to me a bit disturbing and 'twisted'. The melancholy is also emphasized by the half-speed birdsong, especially when a blue tit's short, often-repeated song joins in, though the robin also does a pretty good job of emphasizing the melancholy too! Incredible!\n\nAt least, I see a challenge in this. In my next incarnation, the beginning of which is apparently coming imminent (not on Earth, which is now a sinking ship) (see <b><i><a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/philipgoddard-lights-out-time.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">My 'lights-out' time approaches\u2026</a></i></b>), I'd love to work with chimes ensembles that actually sound radiant and uplifting at half-speed. I do seem to have achieved some remarkable things in this lifetime, so why not a few also in my next one? :-)\n\nActually, with regard to this recording session overall, things weren't straightforward for me. For one thing, the wind wasn't really as strong as had been forecast or indeed as what I was aiming for, and indeed there really wasn't enough wind at all for what I wanted till towards midday. For this reason certain of the recordings are really 'birds with gentle wind chimes sounds (on and off)'.\n\nAlso, I didn't get the chimes balance fully as I was after &#8212; though, generally speaking, the balance was still acceptable, there being no precise right or wrong about this. And then, as part of that issue, really the small chimes were a bit closer to the recorder than would have been ideal, and this led to the non-musical tapping sound of the strikers, particularly of the Mercury and Mars chimes, being intrusively loud on occasions, and in places the diminutive Mars chimes came out really uncomfortably loud.\n\nFor more details about the different chimes used, please go to <b><a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-windchimes.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-windchimes.htm</a></b>.\n\n<img alt=\"Four Woodstock chimes being recorded during the same session\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/140319_recording_wind_chimes_%28several_sets%29_overlooking_teign_gorge_02.jpg\">\n<i>Recording four Woodstock chimes in this session. The recorder (light grey furry windshield) is perched on a small branch rather than on a tripod.</i>\n\n<b>Techie stuff</b>\n\nThe recorder was Sony PCM-M10, with R&#248;de DeadKitten furry windshield. As already noted, it was perched on a tree branch, by means of a GorillaPod.\n\nPost-recording processing was to apply EQ in Audacity to correct for the muffling effect of the windshield &#8212; and then more recently stereo widening / sharpening-up using the VST plugin A1 Stereo Control (160% widening).\n\n<b>Please remember to give this recording a rating &#8212; Thank you!</b>&#160; <img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\">",

        "description": "On 30th January 2013 I took out with me a set of Woodstock Chimes of Pluto and two sets of Music of the Spheres Gypsy wind chimes - the Soprano and Mezzo sizes, the sounds of which latter two mesh together beautifully.\n\nI was aiming for the same recording location as I used for my previous wind chimes recordings - in November 2012 - but this time a very strong wind was blowing over the more exposed parts, and, on the Hunters' Path from Drewsteignton (Devon, UK), high up on the side of the so-called Teign Gorge above Fingle Bridge, as I was coming out of the woods that clothe the steep valley slopes I was suddenly blasted by a wind of about gale force (force 8 on the Beaufort scale), and realized that my previous recording locations here would most likely be too windy this time.\n\nSo, I withdrew very slightly back into the top of the woods, descending slightly to just below the top part of the narrow track that ascends steeply from Fingle Bridge to join the Hunters' Path, and found a suitable group of low tree branches that were sufficiently sheltered to be getting a very nice range of wind strength, from very little indeed up to 'fresh' (force 5 on the Beaufort scale).\n\nThus today was an opportunity to record a gale in the woods, with wind chimes intermingled in the wind sound and indeed quite often buried in it as the most powerful gusts came. The results turned out to be interesting and very much in accordance with what I had been hankering after for as long as I'd been thinking of recording wind chimes. It is important, therefore, to enable yourself to perceive this particular day's recordings NOT as 'failed' or otherwise bad chimes recordings, but as extremely successful gale-in-the-woods recordings complete with wind chimes.\n\nAs well as the wind commotion, actually the River Teign far below was making its own quieter commotion, for it was particularly full after a lot of heavy rain, but during my whole 5+ hours' recording session I could never quite differentiate between the rushing sound of the Teign and the wind.\n\nOne thing you are bound to notice is that the degree of activity of the chimes does not tally all that much with the degree of roaring of the wind in the trees. This is because of my relatively sheltered position, so the big and powerful eddies in the flow of the air as it comes over the hill into the valley go careering through the tree branches above and around me, but the gusts that come to me and the recorder and chimes are almost all NOT those directly but smaller subsidiary eddies that come spinning off the big ones.\n\nIt's inevitable that the wind commotion will make particularly fatiguing listening, especially to the full-length recordings, when played through anything other than really good speakers / headphones. Please note that in the full-length recordings made on this day, ALL of them have some awesomely powerful and loud wind gusts that at times virtually drown out the chimes, so any of the excerpts here seeming louder or quieter than others is in fact misleading, as all the full length recordings have very loud and also almost quiet (albeit far from silent!) moments.\n\nPlease note also, that if you watch the waveform image here on Freesound while playing the excerpts you will NOT get the proper effect. The big wind gusts sound immensely more powerful and even frightening when you are NOT watching that, so you never know how much more the sound is going to increase, maybe to blow you and indeed the whole of Existence away! :-)\n\nAnother listening tip - if you have really good and wide stereo separation you will find that the wind sound is not simply a fluctuating roar (really rather boring!), but a wonderful drama of ogreish 'wind monsters' chasing around here, there, and who knows where! The three-dimensional movement really makes an exciting drama of it all.\n\nThis recording is of the Music of the Spheres Gypsy Soprano chimes. Without being combined with chimes tuned to other scales, the weird, emotionally intense quality of these chimes is able to sing out. \n\nThis is a 5-minute excerpt from the 31+ minutes full recording.\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/recording-nr-top-of-woods-above-fingle-bridge.jpg\">\n<i>This photo shows my recording studio for 30th January 2013 - almost at the top of the north side of the Teign Gorge, and facing obliquely over the valley, so that the great gusts of wind come roaring from the right and then go careering round over and down into the valley. The sets of chimes visible are the Gypsy Mezzo (left, and further away) and the Pluto (right).\nNote that the former being further away is not a bit of carelessness of mine, but a quite deliberate placement. I learnt from my first Gypsy Chimes recordings (back in November) that for best results they need to be placed further from the microphones than the Woodstock or bamboo chimes (at least, those that I have), on account of their more penetrating and potentially overpowering tone.</i><br>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/track-high-above-fingle-bridge.jpg\">\n<i>Looking the other way from near the top of the track ascending from Fingle Bridge, which latter is hidden way down below. The recorder is about 25 metres behind me, just a little down the slope from this track.</i>\n\nRecording made with a Sony PCM-M10 on a Velbon mini-tripod, using the built-in microphones covered with a Rode Dead Kitten.\n\n<img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/arrow-long-right.gif\"> Please note that all recordings from 5th January to 2nd Feb 2013, inclusive (i.e. including this one) did not receive any correction for high-frequency attenuation caused by the new Rode Dead Kitten windshield. Subsequently I was able to work out a graphic EQ profile to apply to all recordings that used that windshield, and have applied it retrospectively - but I have no plans to go through the hassle of re-uploading here the recordings that originally missed out on that correction.\n\nTherefore, copies of recordings made in that period, including this one, which I supply, will have better sound quality and will sound clearer, more 'present', and with more precision of detail than what you hear from here.\n\n<b>Please note that only very good speakers / headphones with a very extended and flat frequency response will do this recording real justice, and, as already noted, lesser speakers / headphones would make this sound quite fatiguing to listen to.  Please also note that the volume level of this recording has been carefully adjusted for listening purposes, and ALL my recordings so far are meant to be listened to with a volume setting that would give a realistic level for playback of CLASSICAL music (a large but not exceptional symphony orchestra). If you have the right volume setting, you should not need to change that setting from one recording of mine to another.</b>\n<p><b>Please remember to give this recording a rating! <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\"></b></p>",

        "description": "<b>Extraordinary-sounding Davis Blanchard Twilight wind chimes, high up in the Teign Gorge. A bright rather steely timbre, and the notes tuned in just intonation on a note sequence incorporating minor triad, minor major seventh, and augmented triad, but normally overall emphasis on something else again &#8212; the exact emphasis sounding at any moment dependent on how the wind is blowing on the tubes, so the different chords come into prominence at different times.</b>\n\nI recorded this on 24 February 2017, on the rough slope just below Hunting Gate, which latter marks the highest point of the Hunter's Path,  high up on the north side of the Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK.\n\nThe distinctive timbre of all the Davis Blanchard chimes is a result of their being made of <i><b>galvanized steel</b></i> instead of the usual aluminium alloy. They proved so heavy physically that I couldn't sensibly carry more than two sets of these to any session &#8212; i.e., in my rucksack, hitch-hiking out and back, and walking between road and recording spot.\n\nHowever, as each set of DB chimes was 8-note, more than two sets of them would be overkill, creating an unworkably complex mass of pitches when hung up, so I probably wouldn't have gained anything useful by struggling to my recording spot with a third set of those &#8212; though later on I was to add a set of much lighter Woodstock chimes to two of these for some deliciously outlandish effects.\n\nThis is one of the many fruits of my <i><b>Wind Chimes in the Wild</b></i> project.

Half-speed version of recording of a wind chimes ensemble in a gale (<a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/Philip_Goddard/sounds/703483/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://freesound.org/people/Philip_Goddard/sounds/703483/</a> ), in the western end of Drewston Woods, just below the Hunter's Path, high up in the Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK. We're sheltered from most of the wind, but gale-force gusts come over the top of the hill, chasing and roaring through the treetops and giving us an interesting time!</b>\n\n<b>Chimes used:</b>\n\n<b>1. Music of the Spheres Gypsy Chimes, Soprano</b> (Eastern European Gypsy scale, higher)\n\n<b>2. Music of the Spheres Gypsy Chimes, Mezzo</b> (Ditto, lower)\n\n<b>3. Woodstock Chimes of Pluto</b> (Pentatonic, with a rather 'major' sound)\n\nI made this recording on 30 January 2013, with a gale blowing. Amazingly, when I came out of the Drewston Woods and found myself being beaten back into the woods by the gale, after a few minutes of dithering, wondering what to do, I decided <i>not to go ahead with this session!</i> The point was, that I was thinking only of recording the chimes, and realized that the chimes sound would repeatedly get lost in the tremendous roar of the stronger gusts. It was then that I used what I nowadays call <i><b><a href=\"https://clarity-of-being.org/glossary.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Helpfulness Testing</a></b></i> <i>(do a text search for that term on that page)</i> to get an intimation from my own deeper aspects of consciousness as to what my best choice would really be at that point &#8212; whether to abandon the session, to record anyway despite the gale trashing it all, or to do something else altogether. My indication then was clearly to record there anyway.\n\nSo, reluctantly I set up the recorder and started recording, repeatedly thinking <i>No, no! This is a waste of time with all this din!</i> &#8212; But then, over about 10 minutes it progressively dawned on me: I'd been wanting to record a gale in the woods all along! Silly, funny me! This was not a chimes recording being trashed by the wind, but a wonderful gale recording with the chimes as a bonus! &#8212; And so from then on I was electrifyingly elated at my wonderful privilege to have got these conditions and now to be recording chimes in a gale or, a gale with chimes, whichever way one cares to look at it!\n\nThe only downer about this became apparent years later, when I used software to sharpen and widen all my PCM-M10 recordings because of that recorder model's atrocious stereo imaging. To some extent the wind sound in these recordings &#8212; most notably the recording of the wind without chimes &#8212; suffered in the same way that any wide expanse of hissy sea sound did, sounding rather to very phasey and having distinct phase cancellation spots in the soundstage when listened to through speakers (though still excellent when heard through headphones). Anyway, that issue seems not to notice so much in the recordings with chimes, and this one is a case in point.\n\n<img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/130206-130130_recording_wind_chimes_in_woods_above_fingle_bridge_03.jpg\" alt=\"The recording location\">\n<i>This recording taking place. The wind was coming over the top of the hill, i.e., from the right and a little behind in this view.</i>\n\n<b>Techie stuff:</b>\n\nThe recorder was Sony PCM-M10, with R&#248;de DeadKitten furry windshield (original, more effective, version). It was set up on a Velbon Mini tripod.\n\nPost-recording processing was to apply EQ in Audacity to correct for the muffling effect of the windshield &#8212; and then more recently stereo widening / sharpening-up using the VST plugin A1 Stereo Control (160% widening). For reducing to half-speed I used the 'Change speed' effect in Audacity.\n\n<b>Please remember to give this recording a rating &#8212; Thank you!</b>&#160; <img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\">",

        "description": "<b>A particularly beautiful-sounding trio of wind chimes, a little east of Sharp Tor, high up in the Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK.</b>\n\n<b>Chimes used</b>\n\n<b>1. Woodstock Chimes of Pluto</b> (relatively high-pitched, on a sunny-sounding pentatonic scale)\n<b>2. Woodstock Chimes of Olympos</b> (tuned to a melancholy-sounding Ancient Greek scale)\n<b>3. Woodstock Gregorian Chimes (Tenor)</b> (tuned to an upbeat-sounding Gregorian Chant scale)\n\nI made this recording on 14 November 2012 on a rather isolated stunted oak tree just a bit east of Sharp Tor, by the Hunter's Path, high up on north side of the steep-sided valley. This was only my second recording session in my <i>Wind Chimes in the Wild</i> series, and I was still quite a newbie to field recording altogether, and for this and all but one other recording made on this day I used the tree I used in the previous session for recording the Pluto chimes.\n\nReally just the one small tree gave insufficient elbow-room to place the chimes so I could get the best ensemble balance &#8212; in this particular case the Pluto chimes didn't come out optimally strongly in the ensemble, because the larger chimes needed to have been hung a bit further back, with the Pluto chimes more in the foreground.\n\nNote that this recording, with transformational processing, is the basis of my forthcoming <b><i>Nature-Symphony 10</i></b>, which currently awaits my getting the right conditions to make some field recordings of newly purchased bamboo chimes for the purpose of mixing certain of those into some of my Nature Symphonies with all-metal chimes, to provide necessary contrast of timbre and additional dramatic events.\n\n<img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/121106_recording_wind_chimes_-_pluto_-_over_teign_gorge.jpg\" alt=\"Recording on same tree during previous session\">\n<i>A recording during the previous session using the same tree, using Pluto chimes (my very first chimes recording, on 6 November 2012). It was a wonder that I got acceptable ensemble recordings at all with all chimes and recorder on this spindly little tree this time. As it is, the Pluto chimes came out with less than ideal strength in the ensembles. We can see the black furry windshield of the recorder, with its tiny tripod precariously astride the branch leading off away from us. I had no GorillaPod back then.</i>\n\n<b>Techie stuff:</b>\n\nThe recorder was Sony PCM-M10, with Rycote Mini Windjammer. It was set up on a Hama Mini tripod, which I regard as not just 'mini' but tiny, and I had that tripod astride a branch &#8212; something I never did again after this session, for after that I got a GorillaPod.\n\nPost-recording processing was to apply EQ in Audacity to correct for the muffling effect of the windshield &#8212; and then more recently stereo widening / sharpening-up using the VST plugin A1 Stereo Control (160% widening).\n\n<b>Please remember to give this recording a rating &#8212; Thank you!</b>&#160; <img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\">",

        "description": "<b>Extraordinary-sounding Davis Blanchard wind chimes, together with a large and small set of cheap bamboo chimes, high up in the Teign Gorge. A bright rather steely timbre, combined with a challenging interaction of scales that are each pretty challenging for most people.</b>\n\n<b>Chimes used:</b>\n\n<b>1. Davis Blanchard Twilight</b> (left)\n\n<b>2. Davis Blanchard Debussy Bells</b> (right)\n\n<b>3. Bamboo chimes &#8212; cheap ones bought from a local store. These are a large and a small set, which I always used together as though they were one instrument.</b> (right)\n\nThis is one of the many fruits of my <i><b>Wind Chimes in the Wild</b></i> project. Perhaps perversely, I'm uploading my recordings in reverse chronological order &#8212; most recent first &#8212;, so the most 'advanced' sounds are tending to come earlier rather than later. \n\n<b><a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-2-windchimes.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Detailed information about the Davis Blanchard chimes</a></b>\n\nI recorded this on 24 February 2017, on the rough slope just below Hunting Gate, which latter marks the highest point of the Hunter's Path, high up on the north side of the Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK.\n\nThe distinctive timbre of all the Davis Blanchard chimes is a result of their being made of <i><b>galvanized steel</b></i> instead of the usual aluminium alloy. They proved so heavy physically that I couldn't sensibly carry more than two sets of these to any session &#8212; i.e., in my rucksack, hitch-hiking out and back, and walking between road and recording spot.\n\nHowever, as each set of DB chimes is 8-note, more than two sets of them would be overkill, creating an unworkably complex mass of pitches when hung up, so I probably wouldn't have gained anything useful by struggling to my recording spot with a third set of those &#8212; though later on I was to add a set of much lighter Woodstock chimes to two of these for some deliciously outlandish effects.\n\n<b><a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-2-windchimes.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Detailed information about the Davis Blanchard chimes</a></b>\n\n<img alt=\"Recording Davis Blanchard chimes just below Hunting Gate\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/170224_recording_wind_chimes_high_up_in_teign_gorge.jpg\">\n<i>This recording taking place, with Twilight on left and Debussy Bells on right. The arrow points to the recorder, with its black furry windshield.</i>\n\n<b>Techie stuff:</b>\nThe recorder was a Sony PCM-D100, with two nested furry windshields &#8212; the inner being a Movo one <b>of rectangular box shape*</b>, and the outer a custom Windcut one &#8212;, and it was placed on a full-size Zipshot tripod.\n\n* <i>Note that I <strong>WARN AGAINST</strong> use of windshields that are of any sort of box shape, for I soon found that they were inherently unsuitable for any decent-quality recording. While no doubt non-box-shaped windshields from Movo would be okay, the presence of relatively flat surfaces, edges and corners creates internal narrow resonance peaks in the treble, which give the latter an abrasive and rather 'screamy' quality, no matter who's made the particular windshields.&#160; When I realized why my recordings had developed that nasty  treble quality I had to go back through all recordings made with that dratted box-shaped windshield, and use Voxengo CurveEQ to enable me to precisely neutralize two narrow treble peaks and thus enable the recordings to sound wonderfully natural rather than bafflingly stressful.</i> \n\nPost-recording processing was to apply EQ in Audacity to correct for the muffling effect of the windshields and correction for the D100's weakness in very low bass &#8212; and then, later on, the aforementioned remedial EQ measure using Voxengo CurveEQ to remove the two narrow treble peaks kindly added by that rogue model of furry windshield.\n\n<b>Please remember to give this recording a rating &#8212; Thank you!</b>&#160; <img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\">",

Chimes used this time are:</b>\n\n<b>1. Woodstock Chimes of Olympos</b> (relatively low-pitched, Ancient Greek scale)\n\n<b>2. Woodstock Chimes of Pluto</b> (moderately high-pitched, pentatonic)\n\n<b>3. Woodstock Chimes of Polaris</b> (higher-pitched, pentatonic)\n\n<b>4. Woodstock Chimes of Mercury</b> (very high-pitched pentatonic)\n\n<b>5. Woodstock Chimes of Mars</b> (very high-pitched and penetrating; not sure what scale!)\n\nI recorded this on 19 March 2014, on the rough slope just below Hunting Gate, which latter marks the highest point of the Hunter's Path, high up on the north side of the Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK.\n\nThe ensemble for this recording gives us a tug-of-war between the seriousness and deep melancholy produced by the combination of Olympos and the pentatonic chimes, and the brilliance of the Mars chimes, which latter inject a few 'major'-sounding notes at the top end. In the full-speed original the overall emotional effect of the apparent 'major'-scale injection is to give an <em>impassioned</em> quality to the overall sound (especially where the chimes are most active), as well as lightening up the serious and melancholy tone of the rest of the ensemble. If you listen carefully and really musically you'd notice that the melancholy / sadness is still there, and it's that which is giving weight to the 'impassioned' effect brought in by the Mars chimes' injections of 'major' into the top end.\n\nHowever, seemingly bafflingly, this half-speed (full octave lower pitch) sound has a dramatically different emotional effect from that of the full-speed original. Gone is any obvious sound of 'major' notes from the Mars chimes being injected into the ensemble, and the overall effect is much more serious, melancholy and anxious, but in an exquisitely beautiful and other-worldly way. It gives me a strong sense of a labyrinthine anxious searching for something pressingly important, which one is doomed never to find\u2026. Of course, that's just my impression, and no doubt other people will get different or at least 'variant' experiences.\n\nAfter close examination of the sound of this version and the original full-speed one, I find that the difference is caused by the Olympos chimes being almost inaudible in the latter version, but rather more so in this one. For this reason, the sound of the full-speed version is actually contrary to my intention, but this one, with the Olympos a bit more audible, is nearer the markk, even though not fully 'there'.\n\nActually, with regard to this recording session overall, things weren't straightforward for me. For one thing, the wind wasn't really as strong as had been forecast or indeed as what I was aiming for, and indeed there really wasn't enough wind at all for what I wanted till towards midday. For this reason certain of the recordings are really 'birds with gentle wind chimes sounds (on and off)'.\n\nAlso, I didn't get the chimes balance fully as I was after &#8212; though, generally speaking, the balance was still acceptable, there being no precise right or wrong about this. And then, as part of that issue, really the small chimes were a bit closer to the recorder than would have been ideal, and this led to the non-musical tapping sound of the strikers, particularly of the Mercury and Mars chimes, being intrusively loud on occasions, and in places the diminutive Mars chimes came out really uncomfortably loud (though the latter doesn't notice in the half-speed versions).\n\nAnother issue for me was that the sound of these combinations, although exquisitely beautiful, was musically not what I'd been expecting, and indeed in some cases (primarily involving the Gregorian chimes) was something that I wasn't keen on (actually sounding sentimental in a weird twisted way!) &#8212; though mitigated by the overall soundscape, with so many birds pronouncing their springtime territories.\n\nFor more details about the different chimes used, please go to <b><a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-windchimes.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-windchimes.htm</a></b>.\n\n<img alt=\"Four Woodstock chimes being recorded during the same session\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/140319_recording_wind_chimes_%28several_sets%29_overlooking_teign_gorge_02.jpg\">\n<i>Recording four Woodstock chimes in this session. The recorder (light grey furry windshield) is perched on a small branch rather than on a tripod.</i>\n\n<b>Techie stuff</b>\n\nThe recorder was Sony PCM-M10, with R&#248;de DeadKitten furry windshield. As already noted, it was perched on a tree branch, by means of a GorillaPod.\n\nPost-recording processing was to apply EQ in Audacity to correct for the muffling effect of the windshield &#8212; and then more recently stereo widening / sharpening-up using the VST plugin A1 Stereo Control (160% widening). This half-speed version was produced using the 'Change speed' effect in Audacity.\n\n<b>Please remember to give this recording a rating &#8212; Thank you!</b>&#160; <img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\">",

        "description": "On 21st November 2012 I took out with me a large and a small set of cheap bamboo chimes and two sets of Woodstock (quality, metal) wind chimes. I hung the chimes on small low branches of a particular well situated stunted tree at Sharp Tor just by the Hunter's Path, which overlooks the over-steepened valley (popularly known as the Teign Gorge, though it is not actually a gorge) very near Castle Drogo. In reality the rocky crag rather blocks off the view and most direct sound from the River Teign at the bottom of the valley, and at this spot it was necessary for me to have the recorder facing the other way, back towards the Hunter's Path.\n\nThe background sound of the River Teign was actually quite a bit louder on this day than it would normally be, because there had been an exceptional overnight rainfall, which had caused quite widespread local flooding events, and thus today the rivers were all very full.\n\nThis recording is of the Woodstock Gregorian Chimes and Chimes of Pluto. The Gregorian Chimes are the tenor version, precision tuned to a Gregorian chant scale. The smaller and thus higher-sounding Chimes of Pluto are tuned to a bright and radiant pentatonic scale. These differently pitched and tuned sets of chimes work beautifully together to give quite a musical effect that goes far beyond the mere sum of the two.\n\nThis is a 5-minute excerpt from the 34+ minutes full recording.\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/chimes-gregorian-pluto-recording-sharptor-drogo-500x375.jpg\">\nThis photo shows my recording studio for 21st November 2012 - on Sharp Tor, high up on the north side of the Teign Gorge. The sets of chimes visible are the Woodstock Gregorian Chimes and Chimes of Pluto.\n\nRecording made with a Sony PCM-M10 on a Hama mini-tripod, using the built-in microphones covered with a Rycote Mini Windjammer. I have used a graphic EQ profile in WavePad to compensate for the slight muffling of the sound caused by the Windjammer. I also used a 3dB reduction of lower bass frequencies in order to lighten a bit the odd very strong wind gusts catching the microphones. \n\n<b><i>I caution that the wind noise in the microphones is bound to sound too intrusive when this recording is played back through speakers / headphones that are prone to boominess; good quality hi-fi speakers with extended and flat bass response are really needed for any of these recordings really to sound right.</i></b>\n\nPlease also note that the volume level of this recording has been carefully adjusted for listening purposes, and ALL my recordings so far are meant to be listened to with a volume setting that would give a realistic level for playback of CLASSICAL music (a large but not exceptional symphony orchestra). If you have the right volume setting, you should not need to change that setting from one recording of mine to another.\n<p><i>(Later note: This recording - with better sound than here - is one of my CD-quality downloads, and can be found in <a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">my e-Store</a>.)</i></p>\n<p><b>Please remember to give this recording a rating! <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\"></b></p>",

Perhaps perversely, I'm uploading my recordings in reverse chronological order &#8212; most recent first &#8212;, so the most 'advanced' sounds are tending to come earlier rather than later. \n\n<b><a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-2-windchimes.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Detailed information about the Davis Blanchard chimes</a></b>\n\n<b><a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-windchimes.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Detailed information about the Music of the Spheres and Woodstock chimes</a></b>\n\nBirds heard include Chiffchaff and Willow warbler.

        "description": "<b>The melancholy sound of Woodstock Chimes of Olympos tuned to an Ancient Greek scale, a little east of Sharp Tor, high up in the Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK.</b>\n\nI made this recording on 14 November 2012 on a rather isolated stunted oak tree just a bit east of Sharp Tor, by the Hunter's Path, high up on north side of the steep-sided valley. This was only my second recording session in my <i>Wind Chimes in the Wild</i> series, and I was still quite a newbie to field recording altogether, and for this and all but one other recording made on this day I used the tree I used in the previous session for recording the Pluto chimes. Really just the one small tree gave insufficient elbow-room to place the chimes so I could get the best ensemble balance &#8212; though with just the Olympos chimes for this recording, it was okay.\n\n\n<img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/121106_recording_wind_chimes_-_pluto_-_over_teign_gorge.jpg\" alt=\"Recording on same tree during previous session\">\n<i>A recording during the previous session using the same tree, using Pluto chimes (my very first chimes recording, on 6 November 2012). It was a wonder that I got acceptable ensemble recordings at all with all chimes and recorder on this spindly little tree this time.

Woodstock Chimes of Olympos</b> (relatively low-pitched Ancient Greek scale)\n\n<b>2. Woodstock Chimes of Polaris</b> (fairly high-pitched, pentatonic)\n\n<b>Puzzlingly, a strong emotional atmosphere that I pick up from this duo's sound is that of a pervasive deep melancholy or sadness \u2014 much more profound than that experienced from any ordinary music composed  to be 'sad'. This effect is from the combination of the Olympus chimes \u2014 which on their own sound quite melancholic \u2014 with any of the pentatonic ones in a higher pitch range. This is really odd, because each of the pentatonic chimes on its own, or any of them together, have a radiant sunny sort of sound, which you'd think would dispel any sadness or melancholy rather than intensify and deepen it!</b>\n\n<b>Here I used just the middling-high-pitched one of my pentatonic chimes with the Olympos chimes, and the effect is disturbingly other-worldly \u2014 so beautiful, yet like a great palace of immense sadnesses (the effect is augmented in this half-speed version of the recording). It seems to be telling a compelling story, yet we cannot fathom what it is\u2026</b>\n\nI recorded this on 1 April 2014, on the rough slope just below Hunting Gate, which latter marks the highest point of the Hunter's Path, high up on the north side of the Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK.\n\nFor more details about the different chimes used, please go to <b><a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-windchimes.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-windchimes.htm</a></b>.\n\n<img alt=\"Four Woodstock chimes in earlier session at same spot\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/140401-140319_recording_wind_chimes_%28several_sets%29_overlooking_teign_gorge_02.jpg\">\n<i>Recording four Woodstock chimes in an earlier session (19 March 2014).

Chimes used this time are:</b>\n\n<b>1. Woodstock Olympos Chimes</b> (relatively low-pitched, an Ancient Greek scale)\n\n<b>2. Woodstock Gregorian Chimes (Tenor)</b> (relatively low-pitched, a Gregorian chant scale)\n\n<b>3. Woodstock Chimes of Pluto</b> (moderately high-pitched, pentatonic)\n\n<b>4. Woodstock Chimes of Polaris</b> (higher-pitched, pentatonic)\n\n<b>5. Woodstock Chimes of Mercury</b> (very high-pitched pentatonic)\n\n<b>Exquisitely beautiful, but\u2026! \u2014 Here we have a weird combination that is sure to give some people a pretty uneasy sense of something not being quite right under the surface. For starters, we have the combination of the moderately melancholic-sounding Olympos chimes with all three of my radiant-sounding pentatonic-sounding smaller chimes. That would make for an intense and 'raw'-feeling melancholy / sadness. But then the Gregorian chimes inject a pretentious 'looking forward to a glorious future' glow effect into the proceedings, superficially hiding the melancholy under its cloak of pretence.</b>\n\n<b>The more aware and sensitive listener would no doubt get a similar impression to my own, of an uneasy, 'twisted' quality of that 'glorious future' glow effect, for you don't have to listen far below the surface to realize that the whole show is still coloured by the underlying intense melancholy, which is simply being partially glossed over and not genuinely resolved.</b>\n\n<b>In this half-speed version the same is true, except that the overall tone is now much more clearly melancholic, but still tempered with a sort of sweetness from the Gregorian chimes, which in this context sounds to me somehow a bit twisted and 'not quite right'.</b>\n\nI recorded this on 19 March 2014, on the rough slope just below Hunting Gate, which latter marks the highest point of the Hunter's Path, high up on the north side of the Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK.\n\nActually, with regard to this recording session overall, things weren't straightforward for me. For one thing, the wind wasn't really as strong as had been forecast or indeed as what I was aiming for, and indeed there really wasn't enough wind at all for what I wanted till towards midday. For this reason certain of the recordings are really 'birds with gentle wind chimes sounds (on and off)'.\n\nAlso, I didn't get the chimes balance fully as I was after &#8212; though, generally speaking, the balance was still acceptable, there being no precise right or wrong about this. And then, as part of that issue, really the small chimes were a bit closer to the recorder than would have been ideal, and this led to the non-musical tapping sound of the strikers, particularly of the Mercury and Mars chimes, being intrusively loud on occasions, and in places the diminutive Mars chimes came out really uncomfortably loud (though the latter doesn't notice in the half-speed versions).\n\nAnother issue for me was that the sound of these combinations, although exquisitely beautiful, was musically not what I'd been expecting, and indeed in some cases (primarily involving the Gregorian chimes) was something that I wasn't keen on (actually sounding sentimental in a weird twisted way!) &#8212; though mitigated by the overall soundscape, with so many birds pronouncing their springtime territories.\n\nFor more details about the different chimes used, please go to <b><a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-windchimes.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-windchimes.htm</a></b>.\n\n<img alt=\"Four Woodstock chimes being recorded during the same session\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/140319_recording_wind_chimes_%28several_sets%29_overlooking_teign_gorge_02.jpg\">\n<i>Recording four Woodstock chimes in this session.

        "description": "On 5th March 2013 I took out with me a large and a small set of cheap bamboo chimes and three sets of quality metal wind chimes, to my regular field recording location for wind chimes - the Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK. On this occasion, for the first hour of my walk-in from Drewsteignton, I was greeted by unexpected lack of wind altogether. Fine for recording birds, but not for the chimes!\n\nThen, rather resigning myself to recording birds-only, and to my chimes being just a tiresome dead-weight, out on the long mostly open and relatively level stretch of the Hunter's Path, high up on the north side of the steep sided valley, I noticed a particular nicely situated stunted oak tree that seemed to be beckoning me, pointing out to me that it had a nice arrangement of suitable branches, which would enable me to get the right balance between the different sets of chimes.\n\nAll very well, of course, and for noting to use another time, but, of course, no wind! - Well, except that just that moment breaths of wind started coming on, just enough to make twigs move. And so it was that I set up here, with the wind gradually getting up and actually giving me a lovely performance from the chimes after all.\n\nThere was more than one fly in the ointment, however, for a whole succession of mostly high-altitude aeroplanes came over, so I had to cut out quite a number of bits in this recording, and still there are some brief bits of very distant aeroplane sound in the edited recording - and also, there must have been a tractor at work in the field that tops the hill on this side, for I could hear a quiet sort-of nag-nag-nagging of very low frequency motor noise.\n\nUnfortunately that continued for so long that I could not realistically cut out all the affected bits or I would have little recording left at all, so I cut out the worst and have just had to accept that this recording, although very beautiful, is a bit 'blighted'. At that point I chose to draw a line and just accept all the sounds that were still 'in' as part of the particular countryside soundscape.\n\nThe chimes used are bamboo chimes, large and small set (imprecisely tuned to a semblance of the whole tone scale), Woodstock Chimes of Pluto (tuned to a radiant 'happy' pentatonic scale), and Music of the Spheres Gypsy Chimes, Mezzo and Soprano sizes (tuned to a troubled and melancholy-sounding Eastern European Gypsy scale). The combination of the metal chimes sounds remarkably different from either on their own, and is very beautiful indeed.\n\nAs for the birds in this recording, I am unable to name them all (as yet), though I did definitely recognise chaffinch, skylark, raven, and the odd pheasant. The birds sang less and less during my session at this position, so I was glad to move on presently for recording lower down, where a reasonable number of birds were still singing.\n\nThis is a 5-minute excerpt from the 18+ minutes' recording.\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/recording-chimes-by-mid-hunters-path.jpg\">\n<i>This photo shows actually the following recording taking place, but the only difference is that this recording was using the Chimes of Pluto in addition.</i>\n\nRecording made with a Sony PCM-M10 on a Velbon mini-tripod, using the built-in microphones covered with a Rode Dead Kitten windshield. I have used Audacity to apply a custom EQ profile to correct for the high frequency muffling caused by the windshield, and also to correct for an audible 'hump' in the lower bass frequencies, which I get in ALL my recordings prior to processing.\n<p><b>Please remember to give this recording a rating! <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\"></b></p>",

        "description": "On 6th February 2013 I took out with me to the Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK, a set of Woodstock Gregorian Tenor Chimes and two sets of Music of the Spheres Gypsy wind chimes. I was aiming for another full day's recording near the top of the woods above Fingle Bridge - and indeed I did last out for a full morning there - but then I had to pack up and flee because the air temperature was only about 4 degrees, with some wind-chill factor as well, and my hands and feet were causing me stress through being so painfully cold.\n\nI thought that I'd finished recording for the day, but got down to the much more sheltered Fisherman's Path by the River Teign at the west end of the steep-sided part of the valley, turning back downstream along that path just a little, and it was sufficiently sheltered and sunny just by the very noisy Drogo Weir (with fish ladder) for me to sit on a wooden seat there and at last eat my packed lunch - my hands having warmed up by then.\n\nThen I started noticing that actually some modest gusts of wind were coming from the west along the very bottom of the valley here (the general wind direction being northerly), and so as soon as I'd finished eating I tried experimentally putting up and recording a set of chimes in a sequence of different positions beside the river just a little downstream from the weir (an even moderately close recording of the latter itself would have been too noisy for a pleasant 'listenable' recording).\n\n<img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/teign-weir-130218.jpg\">\n<i>Drogo Weir, photographed a couple of weeks later, with probably less than half the flow than was occurring for the current recording.</i>\n\nThis, then, and the other recordings in this particular sequence, was very much of an experiment, with a quite loud river noise and the chimes sound tending to be buried within the river sound except when wind gusts came along and made the chimes more frisky. This recording, and its other 'siblings' taken at this location, then, needs to be perceived NOT a failed chimes recording, but a recording of the river sound with chimes in the midst of it.\n\nThis recording is distinctly white-noisy owing to proximity to the weir (on the right). Generally I would want quieter river sound against the chimes, but actually I had little choice here, because when I sought to get just slightly up the slope, a little more removed from the river, I lost the wind, and so could not use the chimes there anyway. But in any case this was an interesting experiment, and I could come back here another time with more favourable wind conditions and get a more restful balance of river and chimes.\n\nThe chimes in this recording are the Woodstock Gregorian Tenor Chimes, tuned to a Gregorian chant scale, which gives them a bright and 'grand' sound.\n\nThis is a 5-minute excerpt from the 13+ minutes full recording.\n\nRecording made with a Sony PCM-M10 on a Velbon mini-tripod, using the built-in microphones covered with a Rode Dead Kitten windshield. I have used Audacity to apply a custom EQ profile to correct for the high frequency muffling caused by the windshield.\n\n<b>Please note that only very good speakers / headphones with a very extended and flat frequency response will do this recording real justice.  Please also note that the volume level of this recording has been carefully adjusted for listening purposes, and ALL my recordings so far are meant to be listened to with a volume setting that would give a realistic level for playback of CLASSICAL music (a large but not exceptional symphony orchestra). If you have the right volume setting, you should not need to change that setting from one recording of mine to another.</b>\n<p><i>(Later note: This recording - with better sound than here - is one of my CD-quality downloads, and can be found in <a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">my e-Store</a>.)</i></p>\n<p><b>Please remember to give this recording a rating! <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\"></b></p>",

        "description": "<b>Extraordinary-sounding Davis Blanchard Debussy Bells wind chimes, high up in the Teign Gorge. A bright rather steely timbre, and the notes tuned in just intonation on a note sequence on the whole-tone scale, with a fair amount of emphasis on the augmented triad and tritone, and with the odd additional 'striking notes', which add some dissonance. The mewing bird calls near the beginning are from a pair of buzzards soaring above.</b>\n\nI recorded this on 24 February 2017, on the rough slope just below Hunting Gate, which latter marks the highest point of the Hunter's Path, high up on the north side of the Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK.\n\nThe distinctive timbre of all the Davis Blanchard chimes is a result of their being made of <i><b>galvanized steel</b></i> instead of the usual aluminium alloy. They proved so heavy physically that I couldn't sensibly carry more than two sets of these to any session &#8212; i.e., in my rucksack, hitch-hiking out and back, and walking between road and recording spot.\n\nHowever, as each set of DB chimes is 8-note, more than two sets of them would be overkill, creating an unworkably complex mass of pitches when hung up, so I probably wouldn't have gained anything useful by struggling to my recording spot with a third set of those &#8212; though later on I was to add a set of much lighter Woodstock chimes to two of these for some deliciously outlandish effects.\n\nThis is one of the many fruits of my <i><b>Wind Chimes in the Wild</b></i> project. Perhaps perversely, I'm uploading my recordings in reverse chronological order &#8212; most recent first &#8212;, so the most 'advanced' sounds are tending to come earlier rather than later. \n\n<b><a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-2-windchimes.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Detailed information about the Davis Blanchard chimes</a></b>\n\n<img alt=\"Recording Davis Blanchard chimes just below Hunting Gate\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/170224_recording_wind_chimes_high_up_in_teign_gorge.jpg\">\n<i>Recording two Davis Blanchard chimes plus a large and small set of cheap bamboo chimes in this session. The arrow points to the recorder, with its black furry windshield.</i>\n\n<i>For this recording (just the one set of chimes), the hanging position was very roughly intermediate between those of the two Davis Blanchard chimes in this view.</i>\n\n<b>Techie stuff:</b>\nThe recorder was a Sony PCM-D100, with two nested furry windshields &#8212; the inner being a Movo one <b>of rectangular box shape*</b>, and the outer a custom Windcut one &#8212;, and it was placed on a full-size Zipshot tripod.\n\n* <i>Note that I <strong>WARN AGAINST</strong> use of windshields that are of any sort of box shape, for I soon found that they were inherently unsuitable for any decent-quality recording. While no doubt non-box-shaped windshields from Movo would be okay, the presence of relatively flat surfaces, edges and corners creates internal narrow \nresonance peaks in the treble, which give the latter an abrasive and rather 'screamy' quality, no matter who's made the particular windshields.&#160; When I realized why my recordings had developed that nasty  treble quality I had to go back through all recordings made with that dratted box-shaped windshield, and use Voxengo CurveEQ to enable me to precisely neutralize two narrow treble peaks and thus enable the recordings to sound wonderfully natural rather than bafflingly stressful.</i> \n\nPost-recording processing was to apply EQ in Audacity to correct for the muffling effect of the windshields and correction for the D100's weakness in very low bass &#8212; and then, later on, the aforementioned remedial EQ measure using Voxengo CurveEQ to remove the two narrow treble peaks kindly added by that rogue model of furry windshield.\n\n<b>Please remember to give this recording a rating &#8212; Thank you!</b>&#160; <img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\">",

Woodstock Chimes of Olympos</b> (relatively low-pitched Ancient Greek scale)\n\n<b>2. Woodstock Chimes of Polaris</b> (fairly high-pitched, pentatonic)\n\n<b>3. Woodstock Chimes of Mercury</b> (very high-pitched, pentatonic)\n\n<b>Puzzlingly, a strong emotional atmosphere that I pick up from this ensemble's sound is that of a pervasive deep melancholy or sadness \u2014 much more profound than that experienced from any ordinary music composed to be 'sad'. This effect is from the combination of the Olympus chimes \u2014 which on their own sound quite melancholic \u2014 with any of the pentatonic ones in a higher pitch range. This is really odd, because each of the pentatonic chimes on its own, or any of them together, have a radiant sunny sort of sound, which you'd think would dispel any sadness or melancholy rather than intensify and deepen it!</b>\n\n<b>Here I used the higher two of my pentatonic chimes with the Olympos chimes, and the effect is disturbingly other-worldly \u2014 so beautiful, yet like a great palace of immense sadnesses (the effect is augmented in the half-speed version of this recording). It seems to be telling a compelling story, yet we cannot fathom what it is\u2026</b>\n\nI recorded this on 1 April 2014, on the rough slope just below Hunting Gate, which latter marks the highest point of the Hunter's Path, high up on the north side of the Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK.\n\nFor more details about the different chimes used, please go to <b><a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-windchimes.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-windchimes.htm</a></b>.\n\n<img alt=\"Four Woodstock chimes in earlier session at same spot\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/140401-140319_recording_wind_chimes_%28several_sets%29_overlooking_teign_gorge_02.jpg\">\n<i>Recording four Woodstock chimes in an earlier session (19 March 2014).

I soon got the notion to see if I could get usefully interesting results from producing versions of this half-speed version given a <b>cathedral acoustic</b> \u2014 producing versions that placed the chimes ensemble at a range of distances within the cathedral perspective. I'd never thought to do this before because all other recordings seemed to me to have too much background sound to make a 'cathedral' version a worthwhile proposition.\n\nThat I've now done, and this 'straight' half-speed version is followed here by four 'cathedral' versions of it, ranging from 'close' to 'distance+3' \u2014 the latter sounding quite freaky, though to my no doubt warped senses, still compellingly beautiful in its own way.\n\nHere's the link for the pack I've put those versions in:\n\n<a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/Philip_Goddard/packs/39136/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://freesound.org/people/Philip_Goddard/packs/39136/</a>\n&#160;\n\n<img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/130218_recording_wind_chimes_at_hunter%27s_tor,_teign_gorge_02.jpg\" alt=\"This recording taking place\">\n<i>This recording taking place.

        "description": "On 28th November 2012 I took out with me a large and a small set of cheap bamboo chimes and two sets of Music of the Spheres Gypsy (quality, metal) wind chimes - the Soprano and Mezzo sizes, the sounds of which latter two mesh together beautifully. My intention was to hang the chimes on the same tree that I had used for my recordings a week earlier, at Sharp Tor, by the Hunter's Path, high up on the north side of the over-steepened part of the River Teign valley known as the Teign Gorge, Devon, UK.\n\nIn the event the wind, being from a north-easterly direction this time, was not sufficiently reaching anywhere along there, and I finally reluctantly went higher up on the slope, almost to the top, where a chilly breeze was coming over and moving the tree branches a bit. I hung the chimes on one tree and made one recording, but after nearly 10 minutes of rather modest activity the wind got up more and then appeared to be too continuously on the strong side, so I then moved to a nearby tree that was not catching the wind so strongly, to make the further recordings, including this one.\n\nBeing this high up was not ideal, for the sound of the River Teign in the valley bottom, although still audible, is heard only indirectly and faintly, so, when listening to the recording, it is difficult to tell what is the nature of the very faint continuous roar in the background. Also, here I was very close to the grazed pasture that covers the broad top of the hill, and a result of this is that all this day's recordings are punctuated by faint moos from distant cattle that were far away and out of sight.\n\nThis recording is of the Music of the Spheres Gypsy Chimes, Soprano and Mezzo sizes. These Gypsy chimes, with their particular timbre and tuning to some sort of Eastern European scale, sound at a distance like some ghostly organ playing. People who passed by while I was making recordings with these chimes tended spontaneously to use the words 'haunting' and 'magical'.\n\nThis is a 5-minute excerpt from the 30+ minutes full recording.\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/chimes-bamboo-gypsy-mezzo-recording-above-teign-gorge-450x405.jpg\">\n<i>This photo shows my recording studio for 28th November 2012 - almost at the top of the north side of the Teign Gorge, and facing obliquely away from it. The sets of chimes visible are the large and small bamboo, with the Gypsy Mezzo in the middle.\nNote that actually this was a first time learning experience for me with the Gypsy chimes, and actually for best effects the Gypsy chimes needed to be about twice the distance from the recorder than I actually used on this particular day, on account of their having a stronger and more penetrating tone than my other chimes.</i>\n\nRecording made with a Sony PCM-M10 on a Hama mini-tripod, using the built-in microphones covered with a Rycote Mini Windjammer. I have used a graphic EQ profile in WavePad to compensate for the slight muffling of the sound caused by the Windjammer.\n<b><i>I caution that the wind noise in the microphones is bound to sound too intrusive when this recording is played back through speakers / headphones that are prone to boominess; good quality hi-fi speakers with extended and flat bass response are really needed for any of these recordings really to sound right.</i></b>  Please also note that the volume level of this recording has been carefully adjusted for listening purposes, and ALL my recordings so far are meant to be listened to with a volume setting that would give a realistic level for playback of CLASSICAL music (a large but not exceptional symphony orchestra). If you have the right volume setting, you should not need to change that setting from one recording of mine to another.\n\nN.B. Initially I gave all this day's recordings a 3dB cut of the lower bass to somewhat lighten the sound of the wind in the microphones, and so all the excerpts here from this day's recording have that bass reduction.  However, subsequently, on careful listening, especially through my decent hi-fi speakers, I came to the conclusion that the wind noise in the microphones did not reach a level at which such processing was really necessary, and so I have subsequently restored those bass frequencies to the full recordings, with a distinct improvement in the sound as heard through my hi-fi speakers.\n<p><i>(Later note: This recording - with better sound than here - is one of my CD-quality downloads, and can be found in <a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">my e-Store</a>.)</i></p>\n<p><b>Please remember to give this recording a rating! <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\"></b></p>",

        "description": "<b>Half-speed rendering of part of <a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/Philip_Goddard/sounds/689806/\" rel=\"nofollow\">a 'super-Wow!' wind chimes ensemble hung up from trees high up in the Teign Gorge</a>:</b>\n\n<b>1. Woodstock Chimes of Olympos</b> (relatively low-pitched Ancient Greek scale)\n\n<b>2. Woodstock Chimes of Polaris</b> (high-pitched pentatonic)\n\n<b>3. Woodstock Chimes of Mars</b> (high-pitched, not sure what scale, but different from all the others)\n\n<b>4. Woodstock Chimes of Mercury</b> (very high-pitched pentatonic)\n\n<b>5. Music of the Spheres Gypsy Mezzo</b> (Eastern European Gypsy scale)\n\n<b>6. Music of the Spheres Gypsy Soprano</b> (ditto, but lower, and different mode on that scale)\n\n<b>Most appropriately, a strong emotional atmosphere that I pick up from this ensemble's sound is that of an unimaginably strong and persistent sense of <i>SURPRISE</i>, as though felt from some very deep source. That effect is primarily from the combination of the Gypsy chimes &#8212; which on their own sound deeply melancholic &#8212; with any of the pentatonic ones, and here is spiced up with the Olympos chimes, giving some dissonant touches reminiscent of some music of B&#233;la Bart&#243;k, and the Mars chimes giving a really odd suggestion of a major scale poking out at times in the top end. Sounds like fun? &#8212; Well, at least this errant monkey thinks so!</b>\n\nI recorded this on 15 April 2014, on the rough slope just below Hunting Gate, which latter marks the highest point of the Hunter's Path, high up on the north side of the Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK.\n\nThis was a particularly bold musical adventure of mine. To my ears this has come out as something incredibly beautiful, in a challenging and healthily invigorating way. We <em>need</em> our horizons and brain function opened up and broadened, even if we misguidedly view anything of the sort as anathema! This is all about (further) opening up our ability to experience life with abundance, variety and full vividness &#8212; in short, being fully human! \n\nThis took a lot of time to set up in order to get optimal balance between the different chimes and so to achieve a reasonable ensemble effect. The Gypsy chimes in particular always needed to be further away than the Woodstock ones because of their strong and penetrating tone. The Mars chimes really needed to have been a little further away because they were particularly shrill and penetrating, whereas the Mercury chimes (the smallest and highest-pitched) needed to be a little closer still. A perfect balance was really tricky to get anything near achieving, because of the limited number of suitably positioned hanging points on the various tree branches.\n\nFor more details about the different chimes used, please go to <b><a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-windchimes.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-windchimes.htm</a></b>.\n\n<img alt=\"This session's full ensemble\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/140415_ensemble_of_wind_chimes_hung_on_tree_branches_for_recording,_teign_gorge.jpg\">\n<i>The full ensemble for this session &#8212; from left to right: Olympos, Gypsy Mezzo, Mars, Polaris (difficult to see), Mercury, Gypsy Soprano. The Gypsy chimes are further away because of their strong and penetrating tone.</i>\n\n<b>Techie stuff</b>\n\nThe recorder was Sony PCM-M10, with R&#248;de DeadKitten furry windshield. It was placed on a Zipshot Mini tripod, which I regard as more 'midi' than 'mini'.\n\nPost-recording processing was to apply EQ in Audacity to correct for the muffling effect of the windshield &#8212; and then more recently stereo widening / sharpening-up using the VST plugin A1 Stereo Control (160% widening). I used the 'half speed' effect in Audacity to produce this half-speed version.\n\n<b>Please remember to give this recording a rating &#8212; Thank you!</b>&#160; <img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\">",

        "description": "On 30th January 2013 I took out with me a set of Woodstock Chimes of Pluto and two sets of Music of the Spheres Gypsy wind chimes - the Soprano and Mezzo sizes, the sounds of which latter two mesh together beautifully.\n\nI was aiming for the same recording location as I used for my previous wind chimes recordings - in November 2012 - but this time a very strong wind was blowing over the more exposed parts, and, on the Hunters' Path from Drewsteignton (Devon, UK), high up on the side of the so-called Teign Gorge above Fingle Bridge, as I was coming out of the woods that clothe the steep valley slopes I was suddenly blasted by a wind of about gale force (force 8 on the Beaufort scale), and realized that my previous recording locations here would most likely be too windy this time.\n\nSo, I withdrew very slightly back into the top of the woods, descending slightly to just below the top part of the narrow track that ascends steeply from Fingle Bridge to join the Hunters' Path, and found a suitable group of low tree branches that were sufficiently sheltered to be getting a very nice range of wind strength, from very little indeed up to 'fresh' (force 5 on the Beaufort scale).\n\nThus today was not only to be an experiment to see to what extent the Gypsy chimes could usefully be combined with any of the quite different sounding Woodstock chimes, but also an opportunity to record a gale in the woods, with wind chimes intermingled in the wind sound and indeed quite often buried in it as the most powerful gusts came. The results turned out to be interesting and very much in accordance with what I had been hankering after for as long as I'd been thinking of recording wind chimes. It is important, therefore, to enable yourself to perceive this particular day's recordings NOT as 'failed' or otherwise bad chimes recordings, but as extremely successful gale-in-the-woods recordings complete with wind chimes.\n\nAs well as the wind commotion, actually the River Teign far below was making its own quieter commotion, for it was particularly full after a lot of heavy rain, but during my whole 5+ hours' recording session I could never quite differentiate between the rushing sound of the Teign and the wind.\n\nOne thing you are bound to notice is that the degree of activity of the chimes does not tally all that much with the degree of roaring of the wind in the trees. This is because of my relatively sheltered position, so the big and powerful eddies in the flow of the air as it comes over the hill into the valley go careering through the tree branches above and around me, but the gusts that come to me and the recorder and chimes are almost all NOT those directly but smaller subsidiary eddies that come spinning off the big ones.\n\n<b>It is inevitable that the wind commotion will make particularly fatiguing listening, especially to the full-length recordings, when played through anything other than really good speakers / headphones. Please note that in the full-length recordings made on this day, ALL of them have some awesomely powerful and loud wind gusts that at times virtually drown out the chimes, so any of the excerpts here seeming louder or quieter than others is in fact misleading, as all the full length recordings have very loud and also almost quiet (albeit far from silent!) moments.\n\nPlease note also, that if you watch the waveform image here on Freesound while playing the excerpts you will NOT get the proper effect. The big wind gusts sound immensely more powerful and even frightening when you are NOT watching that, so you never know how much more the sound is going to increase, maybe to blow you and indeed the whole of Existence away! :-)</b>\n\nAnother listening tip - if you have really good and wide stereo separation you will find that the wind sound is not simply a fluctuating roar (really rather boring!), but a wonderful drama of ogreish 'wind monsters' chasing around here, there, and who knows where! The three-dimensional movement really makes an exciting drama of it all.\n\nThis recording is of the Woodstock Chimes of Pluto, plus the Music of the Spheres Gypsy Chimes, Soprano size. The combination of the Pluto and Gypsy chimes produces a curious effect. The Pluto chimes neutralize the intense emotional feel of the Gypsy chimes, and at the same time the latter neutralize the Pluto Chimes' buoyant 'happy' feel, and the combination has a delicately wistful sound as heard on my quite reasonable computer speakers. However, on my hi-fi system comes a revelation, and the effect is not really wistful at all but an almost happy and rejoicing sound, centred in certain gentle and teasing harmonic astringencies that this chimes combination has brought us.\n\nThis is a 5-minute excerpt from the 39+ minutes full recording.\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/recording-nr-top-of-woods-above-fingle-bridge.jpg\">\n<i>This photo shows my recording studio for 30th January 2013 - almost at the top of the north side of the Teign Gorge, and facing obliquely over the valley, so that the great gusts of wind come roaring from the right and then go careering round over and down into the valley. The sets of chimes visible are the Gypsy Mezzo (left, and further away) and the Pluto (right).\nNote that the former being further away is not a bit of carelessness of mine, but a quite deliberate placement. I learnt from my first Gypsy Chimes recordings (back in November) that for best results those particular chimes need to be placed further from the microphones than the Woodstock or bamboo chimes (at least, those that I have), on account of their more penetrating and potentially overpowering tone.</i><br>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/track-high-above-fingle-bridge.jpg\">\n<i>Looking the other way from near the top of the track ascending from Fingle Bridge, which latter is hidden way down below. The recorder is about 25 metres behind me, just a little down the slope from this track.</i>\n\nRecording made with a Sony PCM-M10 on a Velbon mini-tripod, using the built-in microphones covered with a Rode Dead Kitten.\n\n<img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/arrow-long-right.gif\"> Please note that all recordings from 5th January to 2nd Feb 2013, inclusive (i.e. including this one) did not receive any correction for high-frequency attenuation caused by the new Rode Dead Kitten windshield. Subsequently I was able to work out a graphic EQ profile to apply to all recordings that used that windshield, and have applied it retrospectively - but I have no plans to go through the hassle of re-uploading here the recordings that originally missed out on that correction.\n\nTherefore, copies of recordings made in that period, including this one, which I supply on CDs or as licensed copies for commercial use, will have better sound quality and will sound clearer, more 'present', and with more precision of detail than what you hear from here.\n\n<b>Please note that only very good speakers / headphones with a very extended and flat frequency response will do this recording real justice, and, as already noted, lesser speakers / headphones would make this sound quite fatiguing to listen to.\n\nPlease also note that the volume level of this recording has been carefully adjusted for listening purposes, and ALL my recordings so far are meant to be listened to with a volume setting that would give a realistic level for playback of CLASSICAL music (a large but not exceptional symphony orchestra). If you have the right volume setting, you should not need to change that setting from one recording of mine to another.</b>\n<p><b>Please remember to give this recording a rating! <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\"></b></p>",

        "description": "<b>A 'Wow!' wind chimes ensemble hung up from trees high up in the Teign Gorge &#8212; but how come it's so emotionally ambiguous? &#8212; See further below for some degree of explanation. Chimes used this time are:</b>\n\n<b>1. Woodstock Olympos Chimes</b> (relatively low-pitched, an Ancient Greek scale)\n\n<b>2. Woodstock Gregorian Chimes (Tenor)</b> (relatively low-pitched, a Gregorian chant scale)\n\n<b>3. Woodstock Chimes of Pluto</b> (moderately high-pitched, pentatonic)\n\n<b>4. Woodstock Chimes of Polaris</b> (higher-pitched, pentatonic)\n\n<b>5. Woodstock Chimes of Mercury</b> (very high-pitched pentatonic)\n\n<b>Exquisitely beautiful, but\u2026! \u2014 Here we have a weird combination that is sure to give some people a pretty uneasy sense of something not being quite right under the surface. For starters, we have the combination of the moderately melancholic-sounding Olympos chimes with all three of my radiant-sounding pentatonic-sounding smaller chimes. That would make for an intense and 'raw'-feeling melancholy / sadness.</b>\n\n<b>But then the Gregorian chimes inject a pretentious 'looking forward to a glorious future' glow effect into the proceedings, superficially hiding the melancholy under its cloak of pretence. The more aware and sensitive listener would no doubt get a similar impression to my own, of an uneasy, 'twisted' quality of that 'glorious future' glow effect, for you don't have to listen far below the surface to realize that the whole show is still coloured by the underlying intense melancholy, which is simply being partially glossed over and not genuinely resolved.</b>\n\nI recorded this on 19 March 2014, on the rough slope just below Hunting Gate, which latter marks the highest point of the Hunter's Path, high up on the north side of the Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK.\n\nActually, with regard to this recording session overall, things weren't straightforward for me. For one thing, the wind wasn't really as strong as had been forecast or indeed as what I was aiming for, and indeed there really wasn't enough wind at all for what I wanted till towards midday. For this reason certain of the recordings are really 'birds with gentle wind chimes sounds (on and off)'.\n\nAlso, I didn't get the chimes balance fully as I was after &#8212; though, generally speaking, the balance was still acceptable, there being no precise right or wrong about this. And then, as part of that issue, really the small chimes were a bit closer to the recorder than would have been ideal, and this led to the non-musical tapping sound of the strikers, particularly of the Mercury and Mars chimes, being intrusively loud on occasions, and in places the diminutive Mars chimes came out really uncomfortably loud (though the latter doesn't notice in the half-speed versions).\n\nAnother issue for me was that the sound of these combinations, although exquisitely beautiful, was musically not what I'd been expecting, and indeed in some cases (primarily involving the Gregorian chimes) was something that I wasn't keen on (actually sounding sentimental in a weird twisted way!) &#8212; though mitigated by the overall soundscape, with so many birds pronouncing their springtime territories.\n\nFor more details about the different chimes used, please go to <b><a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-windchimes.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-windchimes.htm</a></b>.\n\n<img alt=\"Four Woodstock chimes being recorded during the same session\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/140319_recording_wind_chimes_%28several_sets%29_overlooking_teign_gorge_02.jpg\">\n<i>Recording four Woodstock chimes in this session. The recorder (light grey furry windshield) is perched on a small branch rather than on a tripod.</i>\n\n<b>Techie stuff</b>\n\nThe recorder was Sony PCM-M10, with R&#248;de DeadKitten furry windshield. As already noted, it was perched on a tree branch, by means of a GorillaPod.\n\nPost-recording processing was to apply EQ in Audacity to correct for the muffling effect of the windshield &#8212; and then more recently stereo widening / sharpening-up using the VST plugin A1 Stereo Control (160% widening).\n\n<b>Please remember to give this recording a rating &#8212; Thank you!</b>&#160; <img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\">",

One track is louder than the other, due to the mic's faulty preamps.The file is untreated, there are other sounds, voices, cars, but you might use it once trated. Hope it's useful!",

Some are stagnant or static and with few birds.\nThe presents of the colourful red and yellow dry leaves that is still on the trees, creates the noise of the wind with rustling whispers.\nIs a constantly form of natural white noise that is always changing and evolving. These recordings is from my third attempt.\nI think it is very difficult to record the \u201cspirit\u201d and unique sound of the wind. This is pure natural wind sounds (no layering, no post-processing, no synthesizers). Originally recorded at 24 bit Sony DAT TCD-D7 on a Sony ECM-909 microphone. Recorded in Sweden September of 2007 in a wet cold beautiful colourful forest, with all kind of trees, far away from any traffic or human sounds.",

A bright rather steely timbre contrasting with the woody sound of the bamboo, combined with a challenging interaction of scales that are each themselves pretty challenging for most people.</b>\n\n<b>Chimes used:</b>\n\n<b>1. Davis Blanchard Twilight</b> (left)\n\n<b>2. Davis Blanchard Debussy Bells</b> (right)\n\n<b>3. Bamboo chimes &#8212; cheap ones bought from a local store. These are a large and a small set, which I always used together as though they were one instrument.</b> (right)\n\nThis is one of the many fruits of my <i><b>Wind Chimes in the Wild</b></i> project. Perhaps perversely, I'm uploading my recordings in reverse chronological order &#8212; most recent first &#8212;, so the most 'advanced' sounds are tending to come earlier rather than later. \n\n<b><a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-2-windchimes.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Detailed information about the Davis Blanchard chimes</a></b>\n\nI recorded this on 24 February 2017, on the rough slope just below Hunting Gate, which latter marks the highest point of the Hunter's Path, high up on the north side of the Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK.\n\nThe distinctive timbre of all the Davis Blanchard chimes is a result of their being made of <i><b>galvanized steel</b></i> instead of the usual aluminium alloy. They proved so heavy physically that I couldn't sensibly carry more than two sets of these to any session &#8212; i.e., in my rucksack, hitch-hiking out and back, and walking between road and recording spot.\n\nHowever, as each set of DB chimes is 8-note, more than two sets of them would be overkill, creating an unworkably complex mass of pitches when hung up, so I probably wouldn't have gained anything useful by struggling to my recording spot with a third set of those &#8212; though later on I was to add a set of much lighter Woodstock chimes to two of these for some deliciously outlandish effects.\n\n<img alt=\"Recording Davis Blanchard chimes just below Hunting Gate\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/170224_recording_wind_chimes_high_up_in_teign_gorge.jpg\">\n<i>This recording taking place, with Twilight on left and Debussy Bells on right. The arrow points to the recorder, with its black furry windshield.</i>\n\n<b>Techie stuff:</b>\nThe recorder was a Sony PCM-D100, with two nested furry windshields &#8212; the inner being a Movo one <b>of rectangular box shape*</b>, and the outer a custom Windcut one &#8212;, and it was placed on a full-size Zipshot tripod.\n\n* <i>Note that I <strong>WARN AGAINST</strong> use of windshields that are of any sort of box shape, for I soon found that they were inherently unsuitable for any decent-quality recording. While no doubt non-box-shaped windshields from Movo would be okay, the presence of relatively flat surfaces, edges and corners creates internal narrow resonance peaks in the treble, which give the latter an abrasive and rather 'screamy' quality, no matter who's made the particular windshields.&#160; When I realized why my recordings had developed that nasty  treble quality I had to go back through all recordings made with that dratted box-shaped windshield, and use Voxengo CurveEQ to enable me to precisely neutralize two narrow treble peaks and thus enable the recordings to sound wonderfully natural rather than bafflingly stressful.</i> \n\nPost-recording processing was to apply EQ in Audacity to correct for the muffling effect of the windshields and correction for the D100's weakness in very low bass &#8212; and then, later on, the aforementioned remedial EQ measure using Voxengo CurveEQ to remove the two narrow treble peaks kindly added by that rogue model of furry windshield. Audacity's Change Speed function was used to produce this half-speed version.\n\n<b>Please remember to give this recording a rating &#8212; Thank you!</b>&#160; <img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\">",

        "description": "<b>A real 'Wow!' wind chimes duo hung up from trees high up in the Teign Gorge &#8212; but how come it's so beautiful yet sounds so sad?</b>\n\n<b>1. Woodstock Chimes of Olympos</b> (relatively low-pitched Ancient Greek scale)\n\n<b>2. Woodstock Chimes of Polaris</b> (fairly high-pitched, pentatonic)\n\n<b>Puzzlingly, a strong emotional atmosphere that I pick up from this duo's sound is that of a pervasive deep melancholy or sadness \u2014 much more profound than that experienced from any ordinary music composed  to be 'sad'. This effect is from the combination of the Olympus chimes \u2014 which on their own sound quite melancholic \u2014 with any of the pentatonic ones in a higher pitch range. This is really odd, because each of the pentatonic chimes on its own, or any of them together, have a radiant sunny sort of sound, which you'd think would dispel any sadness or melancholy rather than intensify and deepen it!</b>\n\n<b>Here I used just the middling-high-pitched one of my pentatonic chimes with the Olympos chimes, and the effect is disturbingly other-worldly \u2014 so beautiful, yet like a great palace of immense sadnesses (the effect is augmented in the half-speed version of the recording). It seems to be telling a compelling story, yet we cannot fathom what it is\u2026</b>\n\nI recorded this on 1 April 2014, on the rough slope just below Hunting Gate, which latter marks the highest point of the Hunter's Path, high up on the north side of the Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK.\n\nFor more details about the different chimes used, please go to <b><a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-windchimes.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-windchimes.htm</a></b>.\n\n<img alt=\"Four Woodstock chimes in earlier session at same spot\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/140401-140319_recording_wind_chimes_%28several_sets%29_overlooking_teign_gorge_02.jpg\">\n<i>Recording four Woodstock chimes in an earlier session (19 March 2014). On this occasion the recorder (light grey furry windshield) is perched on a small branch rather than on a tripod.</i>\n\n<b>Techie stuff</b>\n\nThe recorder was Sony PCM-M10, with R&#248;de DeadKitten furry windshield. I have no note nor memory as to whether I had the recorder for this session perched on a branch (as in the photo above), or a Zipshot Mini tripod and thus closer to the ground. \n\nPost-recording processing was to apply EQ in Audacity to correct for the muffling effect of the windshield &#8212; and then more recently stereo widening / sharpening-up using the VST plugin A1 Stereo Control (160% widening).\n\n<b>Please remember to give this recording a rating &#8212; Thank you!</b>&#160; <img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\">",

        "description": "Recording made on 6th November 2012 with a Sony PCM-M10 on a Hama mini-tripod, using the built-in microphones covered with a Rycote Mini Windjammer. I have used a graphic EQ profile in WavePad to compensate for the slight muffling of the sound caused by the Windjammer.\n\nMy three wind chimes recordings made on this particular day mark the beginning of a new project of mine, which I provisionally call <b><i>Wind Chimes In the Wild</i></b>, to produce a collection of truly authentic recordings of a range of quality wind chimes out in Nature, where 'the elements' are an important aspect of each recording. I was moved to point myself towards this project because of the sheer awfulness of all the commercial wind chimes recordings that I'd bought or otherwise heard.\n\nThe problem was usually not the chimes themselves, but the sheer laziness and contempt for the listener of whoever recorded / produced those recordings, which turned out ALL to be faked in various ways - either being just repeating loops of a very short recording, or jiggled mechanically and not by any wind, as shown by regularly repeating patterns in the waveform (and far too consistent a sound level), and any wind or other natural sounds clearly just dubbed on, with no relationship between wind strength variations and the chimes activity.\n\nThe only decent wind chimes recordings that I'd found were a small number on Freesound, and they include some really beautiful ones. So, I decided to help fill the gap left by the lazy and profiteering commercial producers of wind chimes recordings, and make real 'in the wild' wind chimes recordings, with full authenticity, including even wind noise in the microphones at times.\n\nThe latter, although for many purposes regarded as undesirable, actually enhances my recordings - at least provided it doesn't get really disruptively loud. After all, if you're out in the wind you do get the wind rumbling, booming and drumming in your ears, and really it's a nuisance only when it gets really strong and gets drowning out what you actually mean to be listening to out there.\n\nOn 6th November 2012 I took out with me three sets of Woodstock wind chimes, with the intent to record some 10 minutes of each solo, and a full half-hour of each of the four possible combinations of these. In the event conditions enabled me to get only three recordings. I hung the chimes on small low branches of stunted trees by the Hunter's Path overlooking the over-steepened valley (popularly known as the Teign Gorge, though it is not actually a gorge) in the vicinity of Sharp Tor, very near Drogo Castle.\n\nThis recording is of the smallest of the chimes I'd brought - the Chimes of Pluto, which are moderately high-pitched and are tuned to a very sweet sounding pentatonic scale (actually a bit sweeter than I prefer!). I hung them on a stunted tree right beside the track, overlooking the very steep slope to the valley bottom, from where you can hear a distinct continuous background rushing sound of the River Teign.\n\nThe only workable place where I could put the recorder was actually with the mini-tripod straddled on a junction of low branches of this tree, and it was distinctly exposed to the wind, which made quite a lot of noise in the microphones, but, at least to me, makes a lot more variety and interest in the recording, though I wouldn't want it any stronger than it gets later in this recording.\n\nI chose not to make further recordings at that spot that day - and since I uploaded this excerpt I have used a graphic EQ profile on the full recording to slightly 'tame' the heaviness of that noise.\n\nActually, for some people the wind in the microphones would be more or less troublesome anyway, simply because it works well only with listening equipment that has a reasonably flat and well extended bass response. Any tendency to boominess, or indeed a significant deficiency in very low frequency response (as would be the case in virtually all computer speakers) would make that wind noise more problematical.\n\nThis excerpt from the 12-minute full recording is the opening five minutes. For some reason, as with the other two recordings I made on that day, there is a fair bit more 'action' and indeed at times boisterousness after the first five minutes - which works out quite satisfyingly when listening to the full recordings.\n\nThe photo below is of the actual setup for this recording, with the recorder on the mini-tripod just visible rather awkwardly astride the base of a branch.\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/chimes-pluto-hunters-path-299x355.jpg\">\n\nPlease note that the volume level of this recording has been carefully adjusted for listening purposes, and ALL my recordings so far are meant to be listened to with a volume setting that would give a realistic level for playback of CLASSICAL music (a large but not exceptional symphony orchestra). If you have the right volume setting, you should not need to change that setting from one recording of mine to another.\n<p><i>(Later note: This recording - with better sound than here - is one of my CD-quality downloads, and can be found in <a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">my e-Store</a>.)</i></p>\n<p><b>Please remember to give this recording a rating! <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\"></b></p>",

        "description": "On 30th January 2013 I took out with me a set of Woodstock Chimes of Pluto and two sets of Music of the Spheres Gypsy wind chimes - the Soprano and Mezzo sizes, the sounds of which latter two mesh together beautifully.\n\nI was aiming for the same recording location as I used for my previous wind chimes recordings - in November 2012 - but this time a very strong wind was blowing over the more exposed parts, and, on the Hunters' Path from Drewsteignton (Devon, UK), high up on the side of the so-called Teign Gorge above Fingle Bridge, as I was coming out of the woods that clothe the steep valley slopes I was suddenly blasted by a wind of about gale force (force 8 on the Beaufort scale), and realized that my previous recording locations here would most likely be too windy this time.\n\nSo, I withdrew very slightly back into the top of the woods, descending slightly to just below the top part of the narrow track that ascends steeply from Fingle Bridge to join the Hunters' Path, and found a suitable group of low tree branches that were sufficiently sheltered to be getting a very nice range of wind strength, from very little indeed up to 'fresh' (force 5 on the Beaufort scale).\n\nThus today was an opportunity to record a gale in the woods, with wind chimes intermingled in the wind sound and indeed quite often buried in it as the most powerful gusts came. The results turned out to be interesting and very much in accordance with what I had been hankering after for as long as I'd been thinking of recording wind chimes. It is important, therefore, to enable yourself to perceive this particular day's recordings NOT as 'failed' or otherwise bad chimes recordings, but as extremely successful gale-in-the-woods recordings complete with wind chimes.\n\nAs well as the wind commotion, actually the River Teign far below was making its own quieter commotion, for it was particularly full after a lot of heavy rain, but during my whole 5+ hours' recording session I could never quite differentiate between the rushing sound of the Teign and the wind.\n\nOne thing you are bound to notice is that the degree of activity of the chimes does not tally all that much with the degree of roaring of the wind in the trees. This is because of my relatively sheltered position, so the big and powerful eddies in the flow of the air as it comes over the hill into the valley go careering through the tree branches above and around me, but the gusts that come to me and the recorder and chimes are almost all NOT those directly but smaller subsidiary eddies that come spinning off the big ones.\n\nIt's inevitable that the wind commotion will make particularly fatiguing listening, especially to the full-length recordings, when played through anything other than really good speakers / headphones. Please note that in the full-length recordings made on this day, ALL of them have some awesomely powerful and loud wind gusts that at times virtually drown out the chimes, so any of the excerpts here seeming louder or quieter than others is in fact misleading, as all the full length recordings have very loud and also almost quiet (albeit far from silent!) moments.\n\nPlease note also, that if you watch the waveform image here on Freesound while playing the excerpts you will NOT get the proper effect. The big wind gusts sound immensely more powerful and even frightening when you are NOT watching that, so you never know how much more the sound is going to increase, maybe to blow you and indeed the whole of Existence away! :-)\n\nAnother listening tip - if you have really good and wide stereo separation you will find that the wind sound is not simply a fluctuating roar (really rather boring!), but a wonderful drama of ogreish 'wind monsters' chasing around here, there, and who knows where! The three-dimensional movement really makes an exciting drama of it all.\n\nThis recording is of the Music of the Spheres Gypsy Soprano and Mezzo chimes. Without being combined with chimes tuned to other scales, the weird, emotionally intense quality of these chimes is able to sing out. As remarked for my November recordings of this combination, at a distance they sound remarkably like some haunting ghostly organ playing. I deliberately placed them at a fair distance from the recorder to get a bit more of that effect - though actually the gustiness of the wind resulted in the chimes often being rather frisky and clangy, and that rather disrupts the 'ghostly distant organ' effect!\n\nThis is a 5-minute excerpt from the 35+ minutes full recording.\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/recording-nr-top-of-woods-above-fingle-bridge.jpg\">\n<i>This photo shows my recording studio for 30th January 2013 - almost at the top of the north side of the Teign Gorge, and facing obliquely over the valley, so that the great gusts of wind come roaring from the right and then go careering round over and down into the valley. The sets of chimes visible are the Gypsy Mezzo (left, and further away) and the Pluto (right).\nNote that the former being further away is not a bit of carelessness of mine, but a quite deliberate placement. I learnt from my first Gypsy Chimes recordings (back in November) that for best results those particular chimes need to be placed further from the microphones than the Woodstock or bamboo chimes (at least, those that I have), on account of their more penetrating and potentially overpowering tone.</i><br>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/track-high-above-fingle-bridge.jpg\">\n<i>Looking the other way from near the top of the track ascending from Fingle Bridge, which latter is hidden way down below. The recorder is about 25 metres behind me, just a little down the slope from this track.</i>\n\nRecording made with a Sony PCM-M10 on a Velbon mini-tripod, using the built-in microphones covered with a Rode Dead Kitten.\n\n<img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/arrow-long-right.gif\"> Please note that all recordings from 5th January to 2nd Feb 2013, inclusive (i.e. including this one) did not receive any correction for high-frequency attenuation caused by the new Rode Dead Kitten windshield. Subsequently I was able to work out a graphic EQ profile to apply to all recordings that used that windshield, and have applied it retrospectively - but I have no plans to go through the hassle of re-uploading here the recordings that originally missed out on that correction.\n\nTherefore, copies of recordings made in that period, including this one, which I supply on CDs or as licensed copies for commercial use, will have better sound quality and will sound clearer, more 'present', and with more precision of detail than what you hear from here.\n\n<b>Please note that only very good speakers / headphones with a very extended and flat frequency response will do this recording real justice, and, as already noted, lesser speakers / headphones would make this sound quite fatiguing to listen to.  Please also note that the volume level of this recording has been carefully adjusted for listening purposes, and ALL my recordings so far are meant to be listened to with a volume setting that would give a realistic level for playback of CLASSICAL music (a large but not exceptional symphony orchestra). If you have the right volume setting, you should not need to change that setting from one recording of mine to another.</b>\n<p><i>(Later note: This recording - with better sound than here - is one of my CD-quality downloads, and can be found in <a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">my e-Store</a>.)</i></p>\n<p><b>Please remember to give this recording a rating! <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\"></b></p>",

Haunting 'suspended in mid-air' sounds from two bamboo and three metal wind chimes, quite exposed on the narrow Hunter's Tor ridge at the west end of the Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK. The cathedral acoustic is close</b>\n\n<b>Chimes used:</b>\n\n<b>Music of the Spheres Gypsy Mezzo</b> (eastern European Gypsy scale, lower)\n\n<b>Music of the Spheres Gypsy Soprano</b> (eastern European Gypsy scale, higher)\n\n<b>Woodstock Chimes of Pluto</b> (pentatonic, middling-high)\n\n<b>Bamboo, large and small set</b> (purchased cheaply from local store)\n\nI made this recording on 18 February 2013 following a recording of bamboo chimes only (<a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/Philip_Goddard/sounds/700526/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://freesound.org/people/Philip_Goddard/sounds/700526/</a> ).\n\n<b>A 'crazy' experiment!</b>\n\nWhen I came to produce this half-speed version (i.e., the original version without any added reverb) I noticed that the background sounds (primarily the River Teign down below and indeed the wind) were hardly noticeable. I soon got the notion to see if I could get usefully interesting results from producing versions of this half-speed version given a <b>cathedral acoustic</b> \u2014 producing versions that placed the chimes ensemble at a range of distances within the cathedral perspective.\n\nThat I've now done, and <b><i>this is the first of four 'cathedral' versions of that</i></b>, ranging from 'close' to 'distance+3' \u2014 the latter sounding quite freaky, though to my no doubt warped senses, still compellingly beautiful in its own way. The greater the distance, the more the metal chimes sound like a spooky distant organ.\n\n<img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/130218_recording_wind_chimes_at_hunter%27s_tor,_teign_gorge_02.jpg\" alt=\"This recording taking place\">\n<i>This recording taking place. The two nearest and apparently higher chimes are the bamboo ones, the rightmost one is the Pluto chimes, and the other two (more distant, with black tubes) are the Gypsy chimes.</i>\n \n<b>Techie stuff</b>\n\nThe recorder was Sony PCM-M10, with R&#248;de DeadKitten furry windshield (original, more effective, version), placed on a Velbon Mini tripod.\n\nPost-recording processing was to apply EQ in Audacity to correct for the  muffling effect of the windshield, and more recent processing with the A1 Stereo Control VST plugin (160% widening). I used the 'Change speed' effect in Audacity to produce this half-speed version. The cathedral effect was produced by the VST plugin Oril River, which is the best free reverb I've so far found, at least for anything that I myself would be doing.\n\n<b>Please remember to give this recording a rating &#8212; Thank you! <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\"></b>",

Woodstock Chimes of Olympos</b> (relatively low-pitched Ancient Greek scale)\n\n<b>2. Woodstock Chimes of Mars</b> (high-pitched; not sure what the scale is!)\n\n<b>Puzzlingly, a strong emotional atmosphere that I pick up from this duo's sound is that of a pervasive deep <i>melancholy or sadness</i> &#8212; though not as intense and profound as when pentatonic chimes are combined with the Olympos.</b>\n\nI recorded this on 1 April 2014, on the rough slope just below Hunting Gate, which latter marks the highest point of the Hunter's Path, high up on the north side of the Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK.\n\nFor more details about the different chimes used, please go to <b><a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-windchimes.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-windchimes.htm</a></b>.\n\n<img alt=\"Four Woodstock chimes in earlier session at same spot\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/140401-140319_recording_wind_chimes_%28several_sets%29_overlooking_teign_gorge_02.jpg\">\n<i>Recording four Woodstock chimes in an earlier session (19 March 2014). On this occasion the recorder (light grey furry windshield) is perched on a small branch rather than on a tripod.</i>\n\n<b>Techie stuff</b>\n\nThe recorder was Sony PCM-M10, with R&#248;de DeadKitten furry windshield. I have no note nor memory as to whether I had the recorder for this session perched on a branch (as in the photo above), or a Zipshot Mini tripod and thus closer to the ground. \n\nPost-recording processing was to apply EQ in Audacity to correct for the muffling effect of the windshield &#8212; and then more recently stereo widening / sharpening-up using the VST plugin A1 Stereo Control (160% widening). This half-speed version was created by use of the 'Change speed' effect in Audacity.\n\n<b>Please remember to give this recording a rating &#8212; Thank you!</b>&#160; <img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\">",

        "description": "<b>Extraordinary-sounding Davis Blanchard The Blues wind chimes, high up in the Teign Gorge. A bright rather steely timbre, and the notes tuned in just intonation on a blues scale note sequence. This is the least dissonant of the four sets of DB chimes that I had, but the steely timbre still gives an intriguing extra 'something' to what could appear otherwise to be a very commonplace scale for many people.</b>\n\nThis is one of the many fruits of my <i><b>Wind Chimes in the Wild</b></i> project. Perhaps perversely, I'm uploading my recordings in reverse chronological order &#8212; most recent first &#8212;, so the most 'advanced' sounds are tending to come earlier rather than later. \n\n<b><a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-2-windchimes.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Detailed information about the Davis Blanchard chimes</a></b>\n\nI recorded this on 16 February 2017, on the rough slope just below Hunting Gate, which latter marks the highest point of the Hunter's Path, high up on the north side of the Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK.\n\nThe distinctive timbre of all the Davis Blanchard chimes is a result of their being made of <i><b>galvanized steel</b></i> instead of the usual aluminium alloy. They proved so heavy physically that I couldn't sensibly carry more than two sets of these to any session &#8212; i.e., in my rucksack, hitch-hiking out and back, and walking between road and recording spot.\n\nHowever, as each set of DB chimes is 8-note, more than two sets of them would be overkill, creating an unworkably complex mass of pitches when hung up, so I probably wouldn't have gained anything useful by struggling to my recording spot with a third set of those &#8212; though later on I was to add a set of much lighter Woodstock chimes to two of these for some deliciously outlandish effects.\n\n<img alt=\"Recording Davis Blanchard chimes just below Hunter's Gate\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/170224_recording_wind_chimes_high_up_in_teign_gorge.jpg\">\n<i>Recording two Davis Blanchard chimes plus a large and small set of cheap bamboo chimes in this session. The arrow points to the recorder, with its black furry windshield.</i>\n\n<i>For this recording (just the one set of chimes), the hanging position was very roughly intermediate between those of the two Davis Blanchard chimes in this view.</i>\n\n<b>Techie stuff:</b>\n\nThe recorder was a Sony PCM-D100, with two nested furry windshields &#8212; the inner being a Movo one <b>of rectangular box shape*</b>, and the outer a custom Windcut one &#8212;, and it was placed on a full-size Zipshot tripod.\n\n* <i>Note that I <strong>WARN AGAINST</strong> use of windshields that are of any sort of box shape, for I soon found that they were inherently unsuitable for any decent-quality recording. While no doubt non-box-shaped windshields from Movo would be okay, the presence of relatively flat surfaces, edges and corners creates internal narrow resonance peaks in the treble, which give the latter an abrasive and rather 'screamy' quality, no matter who's made the particular windshields.&#160; When I realized why my recordings had developed that nasty treble quality I had to go back through all recordings made with that dratted box-shaped windshield, and use Voxengo CurveEQ to enable me to \nprecisely neutralize two narrow treble peaks and thus enable the recordings to sound wonderfully natural rather than bafflingly stressful.</i> \n\nPost-recording processing was to apply EQ in Audacity to correct for the muffling effect of the windshields &#8212; and then, later on, the aforementioned remedial EQ measure using Voxengo CurveEQ to remove the two narrow treble peaks kindly added by that rogue model of furry windshield.\n\n<b>Please remember to give this recording a rating &#8212; Thank you!</b>&#160; <img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\">",

        "description": "On 21st November 2012 I took out with me a large and a small set of cheap bamboo chimes and two sets of Woodstock (quality, metal) wind chimes. I hung the chimes on small low branches of a particular well situated stunted tree at Sharp Tor just by the Hunter's Path, which overlooks the over-steepened valley (popularly known as the Teign Gorge, though it is not actually a gorge) very near Castle Drogo. In reality the rocky crag rather blocks off the view and most direct sound from the River Teign at the bottom of the valley, and at this spot it was necessary for me to have the recorder facing the other way, back towards the Hunter's Path.\n\nThe background sound of the River Teign was actually quite a bit louder on this day than it would normally be, because there had been an exceptional overnight rainfall, which had caused quite widespread local flooding events, and thus today the rivers were all very full.\n\nThis recording is of the two sets of bamboo chimes, which I had purchased locally in Exeter for just a few pounds each, plus the Woodstock Gregorian Chimes and Chimes of Pluto. The bamboo chimes both have rather imprecise tuning, but nonetheless, the large set gives some semblance of a whole tone scale (which is bound to sound interesting when used together with other chimes), and the small set, although seeming more indeterminate in its tuning, adds in a tritone and other 'interesting' intervals to the range of the large set. I have chosen always to use both sets of bamboo chimes together. This combination has an interesting and 'earthy' sort of sound, which, to my ears sounds nice 'as is', but also gives really interesting effects in combination with some of my metal chimes, which I myself at least find really beautiful.\n\nThe Gregorian Chimes are the tenor version, precision tuned to a Gregorian chant scale. The smaller and thus higher-sounding Chimes of Pluto are tuned to a bright and radiant pentatonic scale. The refined ethereal, 'liquid' tone and precise tuning of these metal Woodstock chimes contrast beautifully with the dry, earthy rattlings, clatterings and 'donkings' of the bamboo chimes.\n\nThis is a 5-minute excerpt from the 29 minutes full recording.\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/chimes-gregorian-pluto-recording-sharptor-drogo-500x375.jpg\">\nThis photo shows my recording studio for 21st November 2012 - on Sharp Tor, high up on the north side of the Teign Gorge. The sets of chimes visible are the Woodstock Gregorian Chimes and Chimes of Pluto.\n\nRecording made with a Sony PCM-M10 on a Hama mini-tripod, using the built-in microphones covered with a Rycote Mini Windjammer. I have used a graphic EQ profile in WavePad to compensate for the slight muffling of the sound caused by the Windjammer. I also used a 3dB reduction of lower bass frequencies in order to lighten a bit the odd very strong wind gusts catching the microphones. <b><i>I caution that the wind noise in the microphones is bound to sound too intrusive when this recording is played back through speakers / headphones that are prone to boominess; good quality hi-fi speakers with extended and flat bass response are really needed for any of these recordings really to sound right.</i></b> Please also note that the volume level of this recording has been carefully adjusted for listening purposes, and ALL my recordings so far are meant to be listened to with a volume setting that would give a realistic level for playback of CLASSICAL music (a large but not exceptional symphony orchestra). If you have the right volume setting, you should not need to change that setting from one recording of mine to another.\n<p><i>(Later note: This recording - with better sound than here - is one of my CD-quality downloads, and can be found in <a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">my e-Store</a>.)</i></p>\n<p><b>Please remember to give this recording a rating! <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\"></b></p>",

        "description": "This is the sound of tree branches rubbing against a treehouse during a wind storm. Also the sound of leaves on the tree rustling in the wind. Here is a play by play: 0:00 I start on the outside of the treehouse, near a spot where several branches are rubbing against the roof. The wind overpowers the mics a couple of times but it isn't too bad. There are a few intense gusts which really move the tree and the treehouse which causes me some concern. 3:25 I move to a protected side of the treehouse, to capture the sound of the leaves. 4:42 The neighbor's chickens make a few sounds. 5:08 I must have walked back out into the wind. More leaves. 6:38 More chickens. 6:54 I move over to another spot, where the main trunk of the tree is rubbing against a piece of sheet metal. 8:45 I open the treehouse door and go inside. More creaks, but no rushing wind sound. I'm not exactly sure what the occasional harmonic sound is - I think it may have been a branch that was rubbing against a large board. 10:35 I set the mic down on a shelf just on the other side of the wall where the main branch is rubbing. 11:12 I run out of tape. Later I came back and cut off the branches that were rubbing against the house since they were really moving it around. I was worried that they may cause the house to collapse.If there is interest, I can post WAV clips from this. Or the whole thing. Let me know via a comment below.",

        "description": "<b>Extraordinary-sounding Davis Blanchard Twilight and Debussy Bells wind chimes, high up in the Teign Gorge. A bright rather steely timbre, combined with a challenging interaction of scales that are each themselves pretty challenging for most people!</b>\n\nI recorded this on 24 February 2017, on the rough slope just below Hunting Gate, which latter marks the highest point of the Hunter's Path, high up on the north side of the Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK.\n\nThe distinctive timbre of all the Davis Blanchard chimes is a result of their being made of <i><b>galvanized steel</b></i> instead of the usual aluminium alloy. They proved so heavy physically that I couldn't sensibly carry more than two sets of these to any session &#8212; i.e., in my rucksack, hitch-hiking out and back, and walking between road and recording spot.\n\nHowever, as each set of DB chimes is 8-note, more than two sets of them would be overkill, creating an unworkably complex mass of pitches when hung up, so I probably wouldn't have gained anything useful by struggling to my recording spot with a third set of those &#8212; though later on I was to add a set of much lighter Woodstock chimes to two of these for some deliciously outlandish effects.\n\nThis is one of the many fruits of my <i><b>Wind Chimes in the Wild</b></i> project. Perhaps perversely, I'm uploading my recordings in reverse chronological order &#8212; most recent first &#8212;, so the most 'advanced' sounds are tending to come earlier rather than later. \n\n<b><a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-2-windchimes.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Detailed information about the Davis Blanchard chimes</a></b>\n\n<img alt=\"Recording Davis Blanchard chimes just below Hunting Gate\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/170224_recording_wind_chimes_high_up_in_teign_gorge.jpg\">\n<i>Recording two Davis Blanchard chimes plus a large and small set of cheap bamboo chimes in this session. The arrow points to the recorder, with its black furry windshield.</i>\n\n<b>Techie stuff:</b>\nThe recorder was a Sony PCM-D100, with two nested furry windshields &#8212; the inner being a Movo one <b>of rectangular box shape*</b>, and the outer a custom Windcut one &#8212;, and it was placed on a full-size Zipshot tripod.\n\n* <i>Note that I <strong>WARN AGAINST</strong> use of windshields that are of any sort of box shape, for I soon found that they were inherently unsuitable for any decent-quality recording. While no doubt non-box-shaped windshields from Movo would be okay, the presence of relatively flat surfaces, edges and corners creates internal narrow \nresonance peaks in the treble, which give the latter an abrasive and rather 'screamy' quality, no matter who's made the particular windshields.&#160; When I realized why my recordings had developed that nasty  treble quality I had to go back through all recordings made with that dratted box-shaped windshield, and use Voxengo CurveEQ to enable me to precisely neutralize two narrow treble peaks and thus enable the recordings to sound wonderfully natural rather than bafflingly stressful.</i> \n\nPost-recording processing was to apply EQ in Audacity to correct for the muffling effect of the windshields and correction for the D100's weakness in very low bass &#8212; and then, later on, the aforementioned remedial EQ measure using Voxengo CurveEQ to remove the two narrow treble peaks kindly added by that rogue model of furry windshield.\n\n<b>Please remember to give this recording a rating &#8212; Thank you!</b>&#160; <img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\">",

        "description": "Recording made on 14th November 2012 with a Sony PCM-M10 on a Hama mini-tripod, using the built-in microphones covered with a Rycote Mini Windjammer. I have used a graphic EQ profile in WavePad to compensate for the slight muffling of the sound caused by the Windjammer. I also applied a 3dB reduction to low bass frequencies, to render the wind noise in the microphones a bit less 'heavy'.\n\nOn 14th November 2012 I took out with me three sets of Woodstock wind chimes, with the intent to record about 20 minutes of each solo, and a full half-hour of each of the four possible combinations of these. Because of the likely interruptions through people passing by along the track, plus intrusions from aeroplanes, I aimed to record for longer than the target duration each time, to allow for cutting bits out - as indeed I had to quite a lot. I hung the chimes on small low branches of a particular well situated stunted tree by the Hunter's Path overlooking the over-steepened valley (popularly known as the Teign Gorge, though it is not actually a gorge) in the vicinity of Sharp Tor, very near Castle Drogo.  There is thus a constant quiet background of rushing water far below.\n\nThis recording is of the tenor-pitched Chimes of Olympos, which are tuned to a melancholy-sounding Ancient Greek pentatonic scale. \n\nThis 5-minute excerpt is from from the 18+ minutes full recording.\n\nThe photo below is of the actual tree used for this recording, with the recorder on the mini-tripod just visible rather awkwardly astride the base of a branch. The photo actually shows the setup for the previous week's recording of the Pluto chimes, and the setup for this recording differs only in that I had the chimes on branches directly overlooking the valley slope (i.e. on the left in this view), and the recorder was in the same position except, unsurprisingly, pointing across the valley (i.e. again, to the left in this view).\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/chimes-pluto-hunters-path-299x355.jpg\">\n\nPlease note that the volume level of this recording has been carefully adjusted for listening purposes, and ALL my recordings so far are meant to be listened to with a volume setting that would give a realistic level for playback of CLASSICAL music (a large but not exceptional symphony orchestra). If you have the right volume setting, you should not need to change that setting from one recording of mine to another.\n<p><b>Please remember to give this recording a rating! <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\"></b></p>",

        "description": "<b>An enigmatic 'Wow!' wind chimes ensemble hung up from trees high up in the Teign Gorge &#8212; but how come it's so emotionally ambivalent? &#8212; See further below for some degree of explanation. Chimes used this time are:</b>\n\n<b>1. Woodstock Chimes of Olympos</b> (relatively low-pitched, Ancient Greek scale)\n\n<b>2. Woodstock Gregorian Chimes (Tenor)</b> (relatively low-pitched, a Gregorian chant scale)\n\n<b>3. Woodstock Chimes of Pluto</b> (moderately high-pitched, pentatonic)\n\n<b>4. Woodstock Chimes of Polaris</b> (higher-pitched, pentatonic)\n\n<b>5. Woodstock Chimes of Mercury</b> (very high-pitched pentatonic)\n\n<b>6. Woodstock Chimes of Mars</b> (very high-pitched and penetrating; not sure what scale!)\n\nI recorded this on 19 March 2014, on the rough slope just below Hunting Gate, which latter marks the highest point of the Hunter's Path, high up on the north side of the Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK.\n\nFor this session my four smaller chimes sets (Pluto, Polaris, Mercury, Mars) were put together with the larger Chimes of Olympos and Gregorian Chimes (Tenor), in various combinations. This recording gives us the whole lot, and thus gives some really intriguing and maybe at times rather disturbing effects. Read on for more&#8230;\n\nActually, things weren't straightforward for me over this session. For one thing, the wind wasn't really as strong as had been forecast or indeed as what I was aiming for, and indeed there really wasn't enough wind at all for what I wanted till towards midday. For this reason certain of the recordings are really 'birds with gentle wind chimes sounds (on and off)'.\n\nAlso, I didn't get the chimes balance fully as I was after &#8212; though, generally speaking, the balance was still acceptable, there being no precise right or wrong about this. And then, as part of that issue, really the small chimes were a bit closer to the recorder than would have been ideal, and this led to the non-musical tapping sound of the strikers, particularly of the Mercury and Mars chimes, being intrusively loud at times, and in places the diminutive Mars chimes came out really uncomfortably loud.\n\nAnother issue for me was that the sound of these combinations, although exquisitely beautiful, was musically not what I'd been expecting, and indeed in some cases was something that I wasn't keen on (actually sounding sentimental in a weird twisted way!) &#8212; though mitigated by the overall soundscape, with so many birds pronouncing their springtime territories.\n\n<b>To expand on the weirdly ambivalent musical effect brought in by the Gregorian chimes, I have this to say&#8230;</b>\n\nOn their own, to my own sensibility the Gregorian chimes sound has about it a religion-based pretentiousness, augmented by its strong vibrato, which latter was probably not intended by the manufacturers, but would have been the result of a non-ideal batch of the tubes used to make the chimes. This produces a sort of hollow, pretentious \"This is Heaven and everything's hunky-dory\" sort of message, in denial of all the deeper things we pressingly need to be openly and honestly holding up to scrutiny in our life experience &#8212; a real awareness-blocking sort of mindset, and not something I'd really want to be dealing with!\n\nThen, when this is combined with the immense melancholy / sorrow of the sound of the Olympos and smaller chimes, for me the effect is complex and disturbing, full of an almost agonizing ambivalence and sense of disorientation. The melancholy and sorrow are still there, but wrapped up in a triumphant 'This is Heaven and all you need to know!' message. In places it can sound sort-of sentimental, especially when the Mars chimes are in the ensemble. &#8212; Surreal!\n\nIn fact that is a remarkable parallel to the final climax in my <i><b><a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard-music.co.uk/sym4.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Symphony 4 (Highland Wilderness)</a></b></i>, in which the overall effect appears to be one of an incandescent triumph, yet with something disturbing &#8212; even twisted &#8212; about it. If you separate out the canonic parts you can hear why there's something strange about it. Each of those parts is a descending chordal sequence that is actually sorrowful in effect, including one chordal progression that sounds to embody 'the ultimate profound disappointment' &#8212; an archetypal thing, and not any one little person's individual disappointment or sorrow. I also 'borrowed' and adapted that climax to appear like a bolt from the blue in the final 'eruption' in my <i><b><a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard-music.co.uk/sym7.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Symphony 7 (Ancient Cry for Freedom)</a></b></i>.\n\nFor more details about the different chimes used, please go to <b><a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-windchimes.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-windchimes.htm</a></b>.\n\n<img alt=\"Four Woodstock chimes in earlier session at same spot\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/140319_recording_wind_chimes_%28several_sets%29_overlooking_teign_gorge_02.jpg\">\n<i>Recording four Woodstock chimes in this session. The recorder (light grey furry windshield) is perched on a small branch rather than on a tripod.</i>\n\n<b>Techie stuff</b>\n\nThe recorder was Sony PCM-M10, with R&#248;de DeadKitten furry windshield. I had the recorder for this session perched on a branch by means of a GorillaPod. \n\nPost-recording processing was to apply EQ in Audacity to correct for the muffling effect of the windshield &#8212; and then more recently stereo widening / sharpening-up using the VST plugin A1 Stereo Control (160% widening).\n\n<b>Please remember to give this recording a rating &#8212; Thank you!</b>&#160; <img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\">",

Some are stagnant or static and with few birds.\nThe presents of the colourful red and yellow dry leaves that is still on the trees, creates the noise of the wind with rustling whispers.\nIs a constantly form of natural white noise that is always changing and evolving. These recordings is from my third attempt.\nI think it is very difficult to record the \u201cspirit\u201d and unique sound of the wind. This is pure natural wind sounds (no layering, no post-processing, no synthesizers). Originally recorded at 24 bit Sony DAT TCD-D7 on a Sony ECM-909 microphone. Recorded in Sweden September of 2007 in a wet cold beautiful colourful forest, with all kind of trees, far away from any traffic or human sounds.",

        "description": "On 6th February 2013 I took out with me to the Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK, a set of Woodstock Gregorian Tenor Chimes and two sets of Music of the Spheres Gypsy wind chimes - the Soprano and Mezzo sizes, the sounds of which latter two mesh together beautifully. I was actually expecting a gale as I experienced for my recordings a week before, especially as there had been a gale overnight, but in fact the wind had eased down to a mere 'strong' (force 6 on the Beaufort scale), but it was colder than last time, so this was bound to be more challenging for me (I have Raynaud's disease, the cold extremities problem).\n\nBecause of my expectations of a gale, I made for the same spot as last week - near the top of the track ascending through the valley-side woods to join the Hunters' Path just as it emerges from the woods at the top. This proved still to get a very useful variation of wind strength to work the chimes, also with very nice sound as the wind gusts came through the trees - but generally nothing as spectacularly dramatic as I'd had last week.\n\nI did actually try combining Gregorian and Gypsy Chimes - but these turned out to be incompatible, together producing a chaotic discordant gibberish, and I deleted the two recordings I made with that combination - but fortunately I then went on to make the best of what I had taken out this day, and the resultant recordings have turned out quite beautifully, with a nice background sound from the River Teign far below, and the periodic larger gusts of wind coming through the trees having a lovely detail of sound and helping to give the soundscape a particularly three-dimensional quality.\n\nThis recording is of the Woodstock Gregorian Tenor Chimes, tuned to a Gregorian chant scale, which gives them a bright and 'grand' sound.\n\nThis is a 5-minute excerpt from the 28+ minutes full recording.\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/recording-nr-top-of-woods-above-fingle-bridge.jpg\">\n<i>This photo shows my recording studio for this occasion, but taken the previous week during my gale sequence - almost at the top of the north side of the Teign Gorge, and facing obliquely over the valley, so that the gusts of wind come from the right and then some come swirling around here before they continue across or down into the valley as they will.\n\nThe sets of chimes visible are the Gypsy Mezzo (left, and further away) and the Pluto (right, not used this time).\nNote that the former being further away is not a bit of carelessness of mine, but a quite deliberate placement. I learnt from my first Gypsy Chimes recordings (back in November) that for best results they need to be placed further from the microphones than the Woodstock or bamboo chimes (at least, those that I have), on account of their more penetrating and potentially overpowering tone.</i><br>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/track-high-above-fingle-bridge.jpg\">\n<i>Looking the other way from near the top of the track ascending from Fingle Bridge, which latter is hidden way down below. The recorder is about 15 metres behind me, just a little down the slope from this track.</i>\n\nRecording made with a Sony PCM-M10 on a Velbon mini-tripod, using the built-in microphones covered with a Rode Dead Kitten windshield. I have used Audacity to apply a custom EQ profile to correct for the high frequency muffling caused by the windshield.\n\n<b>Please note that only very good speakers / headphones with a very extended and flat frequency response will do this recording real justice.  Please also note that the volume level of this recording has been carefully adjusted for listening purposes, and ALL my recordings so far are meant to be listened to with a volume setting that would give a realistic level for playback of CLASSICAL music (a large but not exceptional symphony orchestra). If you have the right volume setting, you should not need to change that setting from one recording of mine to another.</b>\n<p><i>(Later note: This recording - with better sound than here - is one of my CD-quality downloads, and can be found in <a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">my e-Store</a>.)</i></p>\n<p><b>Please remember to give this recording a rating! <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\"></b></p>",

What I'm presenting here is part of a 1h 33' recording.</b>\n\n<b>The combination of a minor scale incorporating a minor major seventh chord (Pluto) and the whole-tone scale with the odd additional (dissonant) notes (Debussy Bells) brings a surprise, because out of all the tonal and harmonic conflicts we can hear most of the time a clear <i>major</i> chord, which has almost the persistence of a bagpipes' drone &#8212; though in this context that major chord has quite a tough and steely-severe feel to it. &#8212; Weird, utterly weird and wonderful!</b>\n\n<b>Chimes used:</b>\n\n<b>1. Davis Blanchard Pluto</b> (left)\n\n<b>2. Davis Blanchard Debussy Bells</b> (right)\n\n<b>3. Bamboo chimes &#8212; cheap ones bought from a local store. These are a large and a small set, which I always used together as though they were one instrument.</b>\n\nThis is one of the many fruits of my <i><b>Wind Chimes in the Wild</b></i> project. Perhaps perversely, I'm uploading my recordings in reverse chronological order &#8212; most recent first &#8212;, so the most 'advanced' sounds are tending to come earlier rather than later. \n\n<b><a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-2-windchimes.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Detailed information about the Davis Blanchard chimes</a></b>\n\nBirds don't figure strongly in this particular day's recordings.\n\n<img alt=\"Recording Davis Blanchard chimes just below Hunter's Gate\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/170224_recording_wind_chimes_high_up_in_teign_gorge.jpg\">\n<i>Recording two Davis Blanchard chimes plus a large and small set of cheap bamboo chimes in an earlier session at the same spot (no photos for this session). The arrow points to the recorder, with its black furry windshield.</i>\n\n<b>Techie stuff:</b>\nThe recorder was a Sony PCM-D100, with two nested furry windshields &#8212; the inner being a Movo one <b>of rectangular box shape*</b>, and the outer a custom Windcut one &#8212;, and it was placed on a mini Zipshot tripod.\n\n* <i>Note that I <strong>WARN AGAINST</strong> use of windshields that are of any sort of box shape, for I soon found that they were inherently unsuitable for any decent-quality recording. While no doubt non-box-shaped windshields from Movo would be okay, the presence of relatively flat surfaces, edges and corners creates internal narrow resonance peaks in the treble, which give the latter an abrasive and rather 'screamy' quality, no matter who's made the particular windshields.&#160; When I realized why my recordings had developed that nasty  treble quality I had to go back through all recordings made with that dratted box-shaped windshield, and use Voxengo CurveEQ to enable me to precisely neutralize two narrow treble peaks and thus enable the recordings to sound wonderfully natural rather than bafflingly stressful.</i> \n\nPost-recording processing was to apply EQ in Audacity to correct for the muffling effect of the windshields and correction for the D100's weakness in very low bass &#8212; and then, later on, the aforementioned remedial EQ measure using Voxengo CurveEQ to remove the two narrow treble peaks kindly added by that rogue model of furry windshield.\n\n<b>Please remember to give this recording a rating &#8212; Thank you!</b>&#160; <img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\">",

Woodstock Chimes of Olympos</b> (relatively low-pitched Ancient Greek scale)\n\n<b>2. Woodstock Chimes of Polaris</b> (fairly high-pitched, pentatonic)\n\n<b>3. Woodstock Chimes of Mercury</b> (very high-pitched, pentatonic)\n\n<b>Puzzlingly, a strong emotional atmosphere that I pick up from this ensemble's sound is that of a pervasive deep melancholy or sadness \u2014 much more profound than that experienced from any ordinary music composed  to be 'sad'. This effect is from the combination of the Olympus chimes \u2014 which on their own sound quite melancholic \u2014 with any of the pentatonic ones in a higher pitch range. This is really odd, because each of the pentatonic chimes on its own, or any of them together, have a radiant sunny sort of sound, which you'd think would dispel any sadness or melancholy rather than intensify and deepen it!</b>\n\n<b>Here I used the higher two of my pentatonic chimes with the Olympos chimes, and the effect is disturbingly other-worldly \u2014 so beautiful, yet like a great palace of immense sadnesses (the effect is augmented in this half-speed version of the recording). It seems to be telling a compelling story, yet we cannot fathom what it is\u2026</b>\n\nI recorded this on 1 April 2014, on the rough slope just below Hunting Gate, which latter marks the highest point of the Hunter's Path, high up on the north side of the Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK.\n\nFor more details about the different chimes used, please go to <b><a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-windchimes.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-windchimes.htm</a></b>.\n\n<img alt=\"Four Woodstock chimes in earlier session at same spot\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/140401-140319_recording_wind_chimes_%28several_sets%29_overlooking_teign_gorge_02.jpg\">\n<i>Recording four Woodstock chimes in an earlier session (19 March 2014). On this occasion the recorder (light grey furry windshield) is perched on a small branch rather than on a tripod.</i>\n\n<b>Techie stuff</b>\n\nThe recorder was Sony PCM-M10, with R&#248;de DeadKitten furry windshield. I have no note nor memory as to whether I had the recorder for this session perched on a branch (as in the photo above), or a Zipshot Mini tripod and thus closer to the ground. \n\nPost-recording processing was to apply EQ in Audacity to correct for the muffling effect of the windshield &#8212; and then more recently stereo widening / sharpening-up using the VST plugin A1 Stereo Control (160% widening).

        "description": "<b>A captivating sweet-sounding quartet of high-pitched metal chimes pitted against the earthy rattlings of bamboo chimes, hung up on trees high up in the Teign Gorge on a very breezy day. Chimes used this time are:</b>\n\n<b>1. Woodstock Chimes of Pluto</b> (moderately high-pitched, pentatonic)\n\n<b>2. Woodstock Chimes of Polaris</b> (higher-pitched, pentatonic)\n\n<b>3. Woodstock Chimes of Mercury</b> (very high-pitched, pentatonic)\n\n<b>4. Woodstock Chimes of Mars</b> (very high-pitched and penetrating; not sure what scale!)\n\n<b>5. Bamboo chimes, large + small</b> (cheap unbranded, locally purchased; both sets always used together)\n\nI recorded this on 2 January 2014 on the rough slope just below Hunting Gate, which latter marks the highest point of the Hunter's Path, high up on the north side of the Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK.\n\nFor this session my four smaller chimes sets (Pluto, Polaris, Mercury, Mars) were put together with the bamboo chimes, and then again butwithout the Mars chimes, and finally I recorded just the bamboo chimes. This, the first of the three recordings, gives us the whole lot, and thus the pentatonic sound of the other three metal chimes is generally modified by the Mars chimes into a whole that is different again from any of its components. To me personally the sound of the metal section of the ensemble gives an impression of a quite impassioned folk story set to music &#8212; particularly Irish, though I've no idea why it suggests that to me! &#8212; Maybe something I once heard on an Irish harp&#8230;?\n\nFor more details about the different metal chimes used, please go to <b><a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-windchimes.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-windchimes.htm</a></b>.\n\n<img alt=\"This recording taking place\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/140102_recording_wind_chimes_%286_sets%29_in_copse_by_hunter%27s_path,_teign_gorge_01.jpg\">\n<i>This recording taking place.

What I'm presenting here is part of a 1h 33' recording.</b>\n\n<b>Chimes used:</b>\n\n<b>1. Davis Blanchard Debussy Bells</b> (left)\n\n<b>3. Bamboo chimes &#8212; cheap ones bought from a local store.

Perhaps perversely, I'm uploading my recordings in reverse chronological order &#8212; most recent first &#8212;, so the most 'advanced' sounds are tending to come earlier rather than later. \n\n<b><a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-2-windchimes.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Detailed information about the Davis Blanchard chimes</a></b>\n\nBirds don't figure strongly in this particular day's recordings.\n\n<img alt=\"Recording Davis Blanchard chimes just below Hunter's Gate\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/170224_recording_wind_chimes_high_up_in_teign_gorge.jpg\">\n<i>Recording two Davis Blanchard chimes plus a large and small set of cheap bamboo chimes in an earlier session at the same spot (no photos for this session). The arrow points to the recorder, with its black furry windshield.</i>\n\n<b>Techie stuff:</b>\nThe recorder was a Sony PCM-D100, with two nested furry windshields &#8212; the inner being a Movo one <b>of rectangular box shape*</b>, and the outer a custom Windcut one &#8212;, and it was placed on a mini Zipshot tripod.\n\n* <i>Note that I <strong>WARN AGAINST</strong> use of windshields that are of any sort of box shape, for I soon found that they were inherently unsuitable for any decent-quality recording. While no doubt non-box-shaped windshields from Movo would be okay, the presence of relatively flat surfaces, edges and corners creates internal narrow resonance peaks in the treble, which give the latter an abrasive and rather 'screamy' quality, no matter who's made the particular windshields.&#160; When I realized why my recordings had developed that nasty  treble quality I had to go back through all recordings made with that dratted box-shaped windshield, and use Voxengo CurveEQ to enable me to precisely neutralize two narrow treble peaks and thus enable the recordings to sound wonderfully natural rather than bafflingly stressful.</i> \n\nPost-recording processing was to apply EQ in Audacity to correct for the muffling effect of the windshields and correction for the D100's weakness in very low bass &#8212; and then, later on, the aforementioned remedial EQ measure using Voxengo CurveEQ to remove the two narrow treble peaks kindly added by that rogue model of furry windshield.\n\n<b>Please remember to give this recording a rating &#8212; Thank you!</b>&#160; <img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\">",

Some are stagnant or static and with few birds.\nThe presents of the colourful red and yellow dry leaves that is still on the trees, creates the noise of the wind with rustling whispers.\nIs a constantly form of natural white noise that is always changing and evolving. These recordings is from my third attempt.\nI think it is very difficult to record the \u201cspirit\u201d and unique sound of the wind. This is pure natural wind sounds (no layering, no post-processing, no synthesizers). Originally recorded at 24 bit Sony DAT TCD-D7 on a Sony ECM-909 microphone. Recorded in Sweden September of 2007 in a wet cold beautiful colourful forest, with all kind of trees, far away from any traffic or human sounds.",

        "description": "<b>Half-speed version of part of <a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/Philip_Goddard/sounds/690451/\" rel=\"nofollow\">an enigmatic 'Wow!' wind chimes ensemble hung up from trees high up in the Teign Gorge</a> &#8212; but how come it's so emotionally ambivalent? &#8212; See further below for some degree of explanation. Chimes used this time are:</b>\n\n<b>1. Woodstock Chimes of Olympos</b> (relatively low-pitched, Ancient Greek scale)\n\n<b>2. Woodstock Gregorian Chimes (Tenor)</b> (relatively low-pitched, a Gregorian chant scale)\n\n<b>3. Woodstock Chimes of Pluto</b> (moderately high-pitched, pentatonic)\n\n<b>4. Woodstock Chimes of Polaris</b> (higher-pitched, pentatonic)\n\n<b>5. Woodstock Chimes of Mercury</b> (very high-pitched pentatonic)\n\n<b>6. Woodstock Chimes of Mars</b> (very high-pitched and penetrating; not sure what scale!)\n\nI recorded this on 19 March 2014, on the rough slope just below Hunting Gate, which latter marks the highest point of the Hunter's Path, high up on the north side of the Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK.\n\nFor this session my four smaller chimes sets (Pluto, Polaris, Mercury, Mars) were put together with the larger Chimes of Olympos and Gregorian Chimes (Tenor), in various combinations. This recording gives us the whole lot, and thus gives some really intriguing and maybe at times rather disturbing effects. Read on for more&#8230;\n\nActually, things weren't straightforward for me over this session. For one thing, the wind wasn't really as strong as had been forecast or indeed as what I was aiming for, and indeed there really wasn't enough wind at all for what I wanted till towards midday. For this reason certain of the recordings are really 'birds with gentle wind chimes sounds (on and off)'.\n\nAlso, I didn't get the chimes balance fully as I was after &#8212; though, generally speaking, the balance was still acceptable, there being no precise right or wrong about this. And then, as part of that issue, really the small chimes were a bit closer to the recorder than would have been ideal, and this led to the non-musical tapping sound of the strikers, particularly of the Mercury and Mars chimes, being intrusively loud, particularly in recording 6 as listed below, and in places the diminutive Mars chimes came out really uncomfortably loud.\n\nAnother issue for me was that the sound of these combinations, although exquisitely beautiful, was musically not what I'd been expecting, and indeed in some cases was something that I wasn't keen on (actually sounding sentimental in a weird twisted way!) &#8212; though mitigated by the overall soundscape, with so many birds pronouncing their springtime territories.\n\n<b>To expand on the weirdly ambivalent musical effect brought in by the Gregorian chimes, I have this to say&#8230;</b>\n\nOn their own, to my own sensibility the Gregorian chimes sound has about it a religion-based pretentiousness, augmented by its strong vibrato, which latter was probably not intended by the manufacturers, but would have been the result of a non-ideal batch of the tubes used to make the chimes. This produces a sort of hollow, pretentious \"This is Heaven and everything's hunky-dory\" sort of message, in denial of all the deeper things we pressingly need to be openly and honestly holding up to scrutiny in our life experience &#8212; a real awareness-blocking sort of mindset, and not something I'd really want to be dealing with!\n\nThen, when this is combined with the immense melancholy / sorrow of the sound of the Olympos and smaller chimes, for me the effect is complex and disturbing, full of an almost agonizing ambivalence and sense of disorientation. The melancholy and sorrow are still there, but wrapped up in a triumphant 'This is Heaven, and all you need to know!' message. In places it can sound sort-of sentimental, especially when the Mars chimes are in the ensemble. &#8212; Surreal!\n\nIn fact that is a remarkable parallel to the final climax in my <i><b><a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard-music.co.uk/sym4.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Symphony 4 (Highland Wilderness)</a></b></i>, in which the overall effect appears to be one of an incandescent triumph, yet with something disturbing &#8212; even twisted &#8212; about it. If you separate out the canonic parts you can hear why there's something strange about it. Each of those parts is a descending chordal sequence that is actually sorrowful in effect, including one chordal progression that sounds to embody 'the ultimate profound disappointment' &#8212; an archetypal thing, and not any one little person's individual disappointment or sorrow. I also 'borrowed' and adapted that climax to appear like a bolt from the blue in the final 'eruption' in my <i><b><a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard-music.co.uk/sym7.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Symphony 7 (Ancient Cry for Freedom)</a></b></i>.\n\nFor more details about the different chimes used, please go to <b><a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-windchimes.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-windchimes.htm</a></b>.\n\n<img alt=\"Four Woodstock chimes in earlier session at same spot\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/140319_recording_wind_chimes_%28several_sets%29_overlooking_teign_gorge_02.jpg\">\n<i>Recording four Woodstock chimes in this session. The recorder (light grey furry windshield) is perched on a small branch rather than on a tripod.</i>\n\n<b>Techie stuff</b>\n\nThe recorder was Sony PCM-M10, with R&#248;de DeadKitten furry windshield. I had the recorder for this session perched on a branch by means of a GorillaPod.\n\nPost-recording processing was to apply EQ in Audacity to correct for the muffling effect of the windshield &#8212; and then more recently stereo widening / sharpening-up using the VST plugin A1 Stereo Control (160% widening). For this half-speed version I used the 'Change speed' effect in Audacity.\n\n<b>Please remember to give this recording a rating &#8212; Thank you!</b>&#160; <img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\">",

At this lower speed it's like wandering through an idyllic labyrinth. Chimes used this time are:</b>\n\n<b>1. Woodstock Chimes of Pluto</b> (moderately high-pitched, pentatonic)\n\n<b>2. Woodstock Chimes of Polaris</b> (higher-pitched, pentatonic)\n\n<b>3. Woodstock Chimes of Mercury</b> (very high-pitched, pentatonic)\n\n<b>4. Woodstock Chimes of Mars</b> (very high-pitched and penetrating; not sure what scale!)\n\n<b>5. Bamboo chimes, large + small</b> (cheap unbranded, locally purchased; both sets always used together)\n\nI recorded this on 2 January 2014 on the rough slope just below Hunting Gate, which latter marks the highest point of the Hunter's Path, high up on the north side of the Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK.\n\nFor this session my four smaller chimes sets (Pluto, Polaris, Mercury, Mars) were put together with the bamboo chimes, and then again but without the Mars chimes, and finally I recorded just the bamboo chimes. This, the first of the three recordings, gives us the whole lot, and thus the pentatonic sound of the other three metal chimes is generally modified by the Mars chimes into a whole that is different again from any of its components.\n\nTo me personally, at full speed the sound of the metal section of the ensemble gives an impression of a quite impassioned folk story set to music &#8212; particularly Irish, though I've no idea why it suggests that to me! &#8212; Maybe something I once heard on an Irish harp&#8230;? At half-speed this still gives me that impression, but with a lot more depth, with time to ponder things as you wander through this beautiful labyrinth.\n\nFor more details about the different metal chimes used, please go to <b><a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-windchimes.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-windchimes.htm</a></b>.\n\n<img alt=\"This recording taking place\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/140102_recording_wind_chimes_%286_sets%29_in_copse_by_hunter%27s_path,_teign_gorge_01.jpg\">\n<i>This recording taking place. The recorder (light grey furry windshield) is perched on a small branch rather than on a tripod.</i><i></i>\n\n<img alt=\"This recording taking place &#8212; closer view\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/140102_recording_wind_chimes_%286_sets%29_in_copse_by_hunter%27s_path,_teign_gorge_01-crop.jpg\">\n<i>Cropped part of main image. The small bamboo chimes help confuse identification by having the tubes dyed blackish. The more distant (and small) chimes just right of centre are the Mars chimes, which had to be more distant because of their loud and penetrating tone. The Mercury chimes are hidden by tree trunk on right, but the red object there is its wind-catcher.</i>\n\n<b>Techie stuff</b>\n\nThe recorder was Sony PCM-M10, with R&#248;de DeadKitten furry windshield. It was perched on a tree branch by means of a GorillaPod.\n\nPost-recording processing was to apply EQ in Audacity to correct for the muffling effect of the windshield &#8212; and then more recently stereo widening / sharpening-up using the VST plugin A1 Stereo Control (160% widening). I used the 'Change speed' effect in Audacity to create this half-speed version.\n\n<b>Please remember to give this recording a rating &#8212; Thank you!</b>&#160; <img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\">",

        "description": "<b>Extraordinary-sounding Davis Blanchard Pluto wind chimes, high up in the Teign Gorge. A bright rather steely timbre, and the notes tuned in just intonation on a minor scale note sequence incorporating a minor major seventh chord,&#160; &#8212; the exact emphasis sounding at any moment dependent on how the wind is blowing on the tubes, so the different chords come into prominence at different times.</b>\n\nThis is one of the many fruits of my <i><b>Wind Chimes in the Wild</b></i> project. Perhaps perversely, I'm uploading my recordings in reverse chronological order &#8212; most recent first &#8212;, so the most 'advanced' sounds are tending to come earlier rather than later. \n\n<b><a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-2-windchimes.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Detailed information about the Davis Blanchard chimes</a></b>\n\nI recorded this on 16 February 2017, on the rough slope just below Hunting Gate, which latter marks the highest point of the Hunter's Path, high up on the north side of the Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK.\n\nThe distinctive timbre of all the Davis Blanchard chimes is a result of their being made of <i><b>galvanized steel</b></i> instead of the usual aluminium alloy. They proved so heavy physically that I couldn't sensibly carry more than two sets of these to any session &#8212; i.e., in my rucksack, hitch-hiking out and back, and walking between road and recording spot.\n\nHowever, as each set of DB chimes is 8-note, more than two sets of them would be overkill, creating an unworkably complex mass of pitches when hung up, so I probably wouldn't have gained anything useful by struggling to my recording spot with a third set of those &#8212; though later on I was to add a set of much lighter Woodstock chimes to two of these for some deliciously outlandish effects.\n\n<b>Advisory</b>\nThe opening and indeed much of this recording is quiet or very quiet, but it livens up later on &#8212; so it's best not to turn up the volume.\n\n<img alt=\"Recording Davis Blanchard chimes just below Hunter's Gate\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/170224_recording_wind_chimes_high_up_in_teign_gorge.jpg\">\n<i>Recording two Davis Blanchard chimes plus a large and small cheap bamboo chime in this session. The arrow points to the recorder, with its black furry windshield.</i>\n\n<i>For this recording (just the one set of chimes), the hanging position was very roughly intermediate between those of the two Davis Blanchard chimes in this view.</i>\n\n<b>Techie stuff:</b>The recorder was a Sony PCM-D100, with two nested furry windshields &#8212; the inner being a Movo one <b>of rectangular box shape*</b>, and the outer a custom Windcut one &#8212;, and it was placed on a mini Zipshot tripod.\n\n* <i>Note that I <strong>WARN AGAINST</strong> use of windshields that are of any sort of box shape, for I soon found that they were inherently unsuitable for any decent-quality recording. While no doubt non-box-shaped windshields from Movo would be okay, the presence of relatively flat surfaces, edges and corners creates internal narrow resonance peaks in the treble, which give the latter an abrasive and rather 'screamy' quality, no matter who's made the particular windshields.&#160; When I realized why my recordings had developed that nasty treble quality I had to go back through all recordings made with that dratted box-shaped windshield, and use Voxengo CurveEQ to enable me to \nprecisely neutralize two narrow treble peaks and thus enable the recordings to sound wonderfully natural rather than bafflingly stressful.</i> \n\nPost-recording processing was to apply EQ in Audacity to correct for the muffling effect of the windshields and correction for the D100's weakness in very low bass &#8212; and then, later on, the aforementioned remedial EQ measure using Voxengo CurveEQ to remove the two narrow treble peaks kindly added by that rogue model of furry windshield.\n\n<b>Please remember to give this recording a rating &#8212; Thank you!</b>&#160; <img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\">",

        "description": "Recording made on 14th November 2012 with a Sony PCM-M10 on a Hama mini-tripod, using the built-in microphones covered with a Rycote Mini Windjammer. I have used a graphic EQ profile in WavePad to compensate for the slight muffling of the sound caused by the Windjammer. I also applied a 3dB reduction to low bass frequencies, to render the wind noise in the microphones a bit less 'heavy'.\n\nOn 14th November 2012 I took out with me three sets of Woodstock wind chimes, with the intent to record about 20 minutes of each solo, and a full half-hour of each of the four possible combinations of these. Because of the likely interruptions through people passing by along the track, plus intrusions from aeroplanes, I aimed to record for longer than the target duration each time, to allow for cutting bits out - as indeed I had to quite a lot. I hung the chimes on small low branches of a particular well situated stunted tree by the Hunter's Path overlooking the over-steepened valley (popularly known as the Teign Gorge, though it is not actually a gorge) in the vicinity of Sharp Tor, very near Castle Drogo.  There is thus a constant quiet background of rushing water far below.\n\nThis recording is of the tenor-pitched Gregorian Chimes, which are tuned to a Gregorian chant scale. \n\nThis 5-minute excerpt is from from the 13+ minutes full recording.\n\nThe photo below is of the actual tree used for this recording, with the recorder on the mini-tripod just visible rather awkwardly astride the base of a branch. The photo actually shows the setup for the previous week's recording of the Pluto chimes, and the setup for this recording differs only in that I had the chimes on branches directly overlooking the valley slope (i.e. on the left in this view), and the recorder was in the same position except, unsurprisingly, pointing across the valley (i.e. again, to the left in this view).\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/chimes-pluto-hunters-path-299x355.jpg\">\n\nPlease note that the volume level of this recording has been carefully adjusted for listening purposes, and ALL my recordings so far are meant to be listened to with a volume setting that would give a realistic level for playback of CLASSICAL music (a large but not exceptional symphony orchestra). If you have the right volume setting, you should not need to change that setting from one recording of mine to another.\n<p><b>Please remember to give this recording a rating! <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\"></b></p>",

        "description": "On 5th March 2013 one particular objective of the day at the Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK, was to make a long recording on Hunter's Tor of the bamboo and both Gypsy chimes, because, owing to a silly little mix-up, I missed out on doing that during my 18th February recording session there. However, that aim was to be thwarted, most likely by a little bit of 'operator error', and the 45-minute recording that I thought I had made turned out back at home to be just one second of background noise!\n\nHowever, while that recording was (not!) running, I placed my second recorder in two other consecutive positions, one of which got me a moderately distant recording of the chimes from part-way along the narrow south-running crest of Hunter's Tor.\n\nThat would have been great, but there were really quite major interferences. Unlike in my 18th February recordings here, the wind was from the south, and was making traffic on the Moretonhampstead to Whiddon Down road distinctly audible - something I most certainly did not want in any of my recordings. And then, part way through the recording a confounded cockerel associated with one of the farm cottages down in the woods to the west (left in this recording) started crowing. Whereas the cockerel in my February recordings here was very distant and too quiet to be a problem in the recordings, this one was loud and strident and very definitely a problem.\n\nI did cut out a few of the most intrusively traffic noise affected sections of this recording, but, realistically, I could not cut all that much out without having too little recording left - and there was no way that I could sensibly clear out the cockerel, with its frequent and persistent crowings. (I would point out, though, that the main continuous rushing sound in the background is not traffic but the River Teign some distance below.)\n\nThe net outcome of this is that from my perspective this and the other 'distant chimes' recording made here on this day are really not suitable for use in commercially produced CDs, and so for these particular recordings I make an exception to my general rule of only excerpts of my <i>Wind Chimes in the Wild</i> recordings on Freesound, and have uploaded the full recordings. Maybe some people would even enjoy the disturbances - the traffic sounds, that effing cockerel - not to mention also some dogs briefly having rather a barking match down in the valley! \n\nThe chimes used are bamboo chimes, large and small set (imprecisely tuned to a semblance of the whole tone scale) and Music of the Spheres Gypsy Chimes, Mezzo and Soprano sizes (tuned to a troubled and melancholy-sounding Eastern European Gypsy scale).\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/recording-chimes-hunters-tor-2013-02-18_06.jpg\">\n<i>My 18th February recording session here. The only difference this time was that the Chimes of Pluto (silvery) were not being used, and I didn't realize that the recorder there was not recording! For this recording the all-important second recorder was some way behind the camera position in this photo, part-way along the narrow south-running open and non-wooded crest of Hunter's Tor.</i>\n\nRecording made with a Sony PCM-M10 on a Hama mini-tripod, using the built-in microphones covered with a Rode Dead Kitten windshield. I have used Audacity to apply a custom EQ profile to correct for the high frequency muffling caused by the windshield, and also to correct for an audible 'hump' in the lower bass frequencies, which I get in ALL my recordings prior to processing.\n\n<p><b>Please remember to give this recording a rating! <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\"></b></p>",

Before and behind the building trees in the wind and rain. The rustling of the leaves is clearly audible as monotonous hiss. The sunscreen slats tapping the radiator. Some birds audible. As the sound in the building comes from below and from above. Children playing in the street. Left and right of the microphones, the wind howls through gaps under the doors. Sometimes traffic is audible. A resident comes home on a motorcycle. Sounds from the other apartment audible.\r\n\r\n\r\nGear chain: Rode NT4 XY and Rode NTG1, in Rode Blimp > Sound Devices 302 >Tascam dr-100 Mk2.

Davis Blanchard Pluto</b>\n\n<b>2. David Blanchard Twilight</b>\n\n<b>3. Music of the Spheres Gypsy Soprano</b>\n\nThis was one of the fruits of my final recording in the <i><b>Wind Chimes in the Wild</b></i> project.\n\nPerhaps perversely, I'm uploading my recordings in reverse chronological order &#8212; i.e., most recent first &#8212;, so the most 'advanced' sounds are tending to come earlier rather than later. Because of its challenging nature I chose to restrict this upload to the first 35' of the 93-minute full recording.\n\nWeirdly, just as happened for the previous outlandish chimes ensemble trio recording (26 April 2018), early on we have a quite long episode in which the wind gets up and leads into a light shower, all sounding really dramatic &#8212; then again followed by a period of quiescence with just faint wisps of chimes sound before the wind and chimes return to 'business as (un)usual'.\n\nActually overall this recording has a rather rougher and wilder feel about it than that previous recording, because (a) the tuning mismatch between Twilight and Gypsy chimes is particularly marked, often causing a lot of shimmering 'beats' in the sound, which have an intriguing beauty but wouldn't please all ears, and (b) the wind was really not quite in the right direction this time, and the recording suffered from a lot of intrusive microphone wind noise, which took a lot of work to remove the worst of. Inevitably, then, I had to allow in more microphone wind noise than I wanted to, just cutting out its (many) more intrusive occurrences.\n\nNonetheless, this is a sound that is by turns thrilling and, during quiescence, hauntingly will-o'-the-wispish, suspended over the Teign Gorge soundscape with rushing of the River Teign far below and the spring birdsong coming and going all around.\n\nPositioning is Twilight (L.), Gypsy (R. of centre), placed further back, and Pluto (R.). I wanted the Gypsy to be dead centre, but I was limited by the position of a suitable branch to hang it on.\n\n<b><a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-2-windchimes.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">General information about the Davis Blanchard chimes</a></b>\n\n<b><a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-windchimes.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">General information about the Music of the Spheres and Woodstock chimes</a></b>\n\nBirds heard in full recording include Blue Tit, Chaffinch, Chiffchaff, Linnet, Mistle thrush, Blackbird, Carrion crow, Yellowhammer, Blackcap, Wren, Willow warbler.\n\n<img alt=\"Recording Davis Blanchard chimes just below Hunting Gate\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/170224_recording_wind_chimes_high_up_in_teign_gorge.jpg\">\n<i>Recording two Davis Blanchard chimes plus a large and small set of cheap bamboo chimes in an earlier session at the same spot (no photos for this session). The arrow points to the recorder, with its black furry windshield.</i>\n\n<b>Techie stuff:</b>\nThe recorder was a Sony PCM-D100, with three nested Windcut furry windshields (custom design), and it was placed on a Zipshot Mini tripod, in a position where it was tolerably sheltered from the wind.\n\nInitial post-recording processing was to use Audacity to apply an EQ curve to compensate for muffling from the furry windshields.\n\n<b>Please remember to give this recording a rating &#8212; Thank you!</b>&#160; <img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\">",

        "description": "<b>Half-speed version of part of <a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/Philip_Goddard/sounds/690095/\" rel=\"nofollow\">a real 'Wow!' wind chimes ensemble hung up from trees high up in the Teign Gorge</a> &#8212; but how come it's so beautiful yet sounds <i>so</i> sad?</b>\n\n<b>1. Woodstock Chimes of Olympos</b> (relatively low-pitched Ancient Greek scale)\n\n<b>2. Woodstock Chimes of Pluto</b> (pentatonic)\n\n<b>3. Woodstock Chimes of Polaris</b> (higher-pitched, pentatonic)\n\n<b>4. Woodstock Chimes of Mercury</b> (very high-pitched pentatonic)\n\n<b>Puzzlingly, a strong emotional atmosphere that I pick up from this ensemble's sound is that of a pervasive deep <i>melancholy or sadness</i> &#8212; much more profound than that experienced from any ordinary music written to be 'sad'. This effect is from the combination of the Olympus chimes &#8212; which on their own sound quite melancholic &#8212; with any of the pentatonic ones in a higher pitch range. This is really odd, because each of the pentatonic chimes on its own, or any of them together, have a radiant sunny sort of sound, which you'd think would dispel any sadness or melancholy rather than intensify and deepen it!</b>\n\n<b>Here I used all three of my pentatonic chimes with the Olympos chimes, and the effect is disturbingly other-worldly &#8212; so beautiful, yet like a great palace of immense sadnesses (the effect is augmented in this half-speed version of the recording). It seems to be telling a compelling story, yet we cannot fathom what it is&#8230;</b>\n\nI recorded this on 1 April 2014, on the rough slope just below Hunting Gate, which latter marks the highest point of the Hunter's Path, high up on the north side of the Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK.\n\nFor more details about the different chimes used, please go to <b><a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-windchimes.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-windchimes.htm</a></b>.\n\n<img alt=\"Four Woodstock chimes in earlier session at same spot\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/140401-140319_recording_wind_chimes_%28several_sets%29_overlooking_teign_gorge_02.jpg\">\n<i>Recording four Woodstock chimes in an earlier session (19 March 2014). On this occasion the recorder (light grey furry windshield) is perched on a small branch rather than on a tripod.</i>\n\n<b>Techie stuff</b>\n\nThe recorder was Sony PCM-M10, with R&#248;de DeadKitten furry windshield. I have no note nor memory as to whether I had the recorder for this session perched on a branch (as in the photo above), or a Zipshot Mini tripod and thus closer to the ground. \n\nPost-recording processing was to apply EQ in Audacity to correct for the muffling effect of the windshield &#8212; and then more recently stereo widening / sharpening-up using the VST plugin A1 Stereo Control (160% widening). This half-speed version was created using the 'change speed' effect in Audacity.\n\n<b>Please remember to give this recording a rating &#8212; Thank you!</b>&#160; <img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\">",

        "description": "On 21st November 2012 I took out with me a large and a small set of cheap bamboo chimes and two sets of Woodstock (quality, metal) wind chimes. I hung the chimes on small low branches of a particular well situated stunted tree at Sharp Tor just by the Hunter's Path, which overlooks the over-steepened valley (popularly known as the Teign Gorge, though it is not actually a gorge) very near Castle Drogo. In reality the rocky crag rather blocks off the view and most direct sound from the River Teign at the bottom of the valley, and at this spot it was necessary for me to have the recorder facing the other way, back towards the Hunter's Path.\n\nThe background sound of the River Teign was actually quite a bit louder on this day than it would normally be, because there had been an exceptional overnight rainfall, which had caused quite widespread local flooding events, and thus today the rivers were all very full.\n\nThis recording is of the two sets of bamboo chimes, which I had purchased locally in Exeter for just a few pounds each, plus the Woodstock Chimes of Pluto. The bamboo chimes both have rather imprecise tuning, but nonetheless, the large set gives some semblance of a whole tone scale (which is bound to sound interesting when used together with other chimes), and the small set, although seeming more indeterminate in its tuning, adds in a tritone and other 'interesting' intervals to the range of the large set. I have chosen always to use both sets of bamboo chimes together. This combination has an interesting and 'earthy' sort of sound, which, to my ears sounds nice 'as is', but also gives really interesting effects in combination with some of my metal chimes, which I myself at least find really beautiful.\n\nThe Chimes of Pluto are precision tuned to a very bright and sweet pentatonic scale, and their refined ethereal, 'liquid' tone and precise tuning contrast beautifully with the dry, earthy rattlings and 'donkings' of the bamboo chimes.\n\nThis is a 5-minute excerpt from the 35+ minutes full recording.\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/chimes-gregorian-pluto-recording-sharptor-drogo-500x375.jpg\">\nThis photo shows my recording studio for 21st November 2012 - on Sharp Tor, high up on the north side of the Teign Gorge. The sets of chimes visible are the Woodstock Gregorian Chimes and Chimes of Pluto.\n\nRecording made with a Sony PCM-M10 on a Hama mini-tripod, using the built-in microphones covered with a Rycote Mini Windjammer. I have used a graphic EQ profile in WavePad to compensate for the slight muffling of the sound caused by the Windjammer.\n\n<b><i>I caution that the wind noise in the microphones is bound to sound too intrusive when this recording is played back through speakers / headphones that are prone to boominess; good quality hi-fi speakers with extended and flat bass response are really needed for any of these recordings really to sound right.</i></b>\n\nPlease also note that the volume level of this recording has been carefully adjusted for listening purposes, and ALL my recordings so far are meant to be listened to with a volume setting that would give a realistic level for playback of CLASSICAL music (a large but not exceptional symphony orchestra). If you have the right volume setting, you should not need to change that setting from one recording of mine to another.\n<p><i>(Later note: This recording - with better sound than here - is one of my CD-quality downloads, and can be found in <a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">my e-Store</a>.)</i></p>\n<p><b>Please remember to give this recording a rating! <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\"></b></p>",

        "description": "Recording made on 6th November 2012 with a Sony PCM-M10 on a Hama mini-tripod, using the built-in microphones covered with a Rycote Mini Windjammer. I have used a graphic EQ profile in WavePad to compensate for the slight muffling of the sound caused by the Windjammer.\n\nMy three wind chimes recordings made on this particular day mark the beginning of a new project of mine, which I provisionally call <b><i>Wind Chimes In the Wild</i></b>, to produce a collection of truly authentic recordings of a range of quality wind chimes out in Nature, where 'the elements' are an important aspect of each recording. I was moved to point myself towards this project because of the sheer awfulness of all the commercial wind chimes recordings that I'd bought or otherwise heard.\n\nThe problem was usually not the chimes themselves, but the sheer laziness and contempt for the listener of whoever recorded / produced those recordings, which turned out ALL to be faked in various ways - either being just repeating loops of a very short recording, or jiggled mechanically and not by any wind, as shown by regularly repeating patterns in the waveform (and far too consistent a sound level), and any wind or other natural sounds clearly just dubbed on, with no relationship between wind strength variations and the chimes activity.\n\nThe only decent wind chimes recordings that I'd found were a small number on Freesound, and they include some really beautiful ones. So, I decided to help fill the gap left by the lazy and profiteering commercial producers of wind chimes recordings, and make real 'in the wild' wind chimes recordings, with full authenticity, including even wind noise in the microphones at times.\n\nThe latter, although for many purposes regarded as undesirable, actually enhances my recordings - at least provided it doesn't get really disruptively loud. After all, if you're out in the wind you do get the wind rumbling, booming and drumming in your ears, and really it's a nuisance only when it gets really strong and gets drowning out what you actually mean to be listening to out there.\n\nOn 6th November 2012 I took out with me three sets of Woodstock wind chimes, with the intent to record some 10 minutes of each solo, and a full half-hour of each of the four possible combinations of these. In the event conditions enabled me to get only three recordings. I hung the chimes on small low branches of stunted trees by the Hunter's Path overlooking the over-steepened valley (popularly known as the Teign Gorge, though it is not actually a gorge) in the vicinity of Sharp Tor, very near Drogo Castle.\n\nThis recording is of the tenor-pitched Chimes of Olympus together with the smaller and thus higher-pitched Chimes of Pluto. The Olympos chimes are tuned to a very melancholic sounding ancient Greek pentatonic scale, while the Pluto chimes are tuned to a very sweet sounding pentatonic scale (actually a bit sweeter than I prefer!), and thus there is an intriguing interaction between the two sound worlds, resulting in an overall balancing out of the emotional effects. I hung the chimes on low branches of a stunted tree very slightly off the track, where a rock crag jutted out over the very steep slope to the valley bottom.\n\nHowever, I could not workably put the chimes actually on top of the crag because of lack of trees just there, so the situation of this recording is a bit odd, for the recorder is actually pointing more or less back towards the track, facing away from the valley slope, and placed on a small prominence on that hunk of rock, which latter, thus, is behind the recorder and blocking direct sound from the River Teign far below in the bottom of the valley. However, you still hear the sound indirectly, as a distinct continuous rushing, which is neither wind nor traffic.\n\nTo my ears the wind noise in the microphones adds considerably to the positive effect, very much augmenting the feel of wildness. However, for some people the wind in the microphones would be more or less troublesome, simply because it works well only with listening equipment that has a reasonably flat and well extended bass response. Any tendency to boominess, or indeed a significant deficiency in very low frequency response (as would be the case in virtually all computer speakers) would make that wind noise more problematical.\n\nThis excerpt from the half-hour full recording is the opening five minutes. For some reason, as with the other two recordings I made on that day, there is a fair bit more 'action' and indeed at times boisterousness after the first five minutes - which works out quite satisfyingly when listening to the full recordings.\n\nSince I uploaded this excerpt I came to the conclusion that the wind noise in the microphones did need a slight 'taming', so I used a graphic EQ profile on the full recording to slightly reduce the heaviness of that noise (which is more apparent after the first five minutes).\n\nPlease note that the volume level of this recording has been carefully adjusted for listening purposes, and ALL my recordings so far are meant to be listened to with a volume setting that would give a realistic level for playback of CLASSICAL music (a large but not exceptional symphony orchestra). If you have the right volume setting, you should not need to change that setting from one recording of mine to another.\n<p><i>(Later note: This recording - with better sound than here - is one of my CD-quality downloads, and can be found in <a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">my e-Store</a>.)</i></p>\n<p><b>Please remember to give this recording a rating! <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\"></b></p>",

        "description": "On 6th February 2013 I took out with me to the Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK, a set of Woodstock Gregorian Tenor Chimes and two sets of Music of the Spheres Gypsy wind chimes - the Soprano and Mezzo sizes, the sounds of which latter two mesh together beautifully.\n\nI was actually expecting a gale as I experienced for my recordings a week before, especially as there had been a gale overnight, but in fact the wind had eased down to a mere 'strong' (force 6 on the Beaufort scale), but it was colder than last time, so this was bound to be more challenging for me (I have Raynaud's disease, the cold extremities problem). Because of my expectations of a gale, I made for the same spot as last week - near the top of the track ascending through the valley-side woods to join the Hunters' Path just as it emerges from the woods at the top.\n\nThis proved still to get a very useful variation of wind strength to work the chimes, also with very nice sound as the wind gusts came through the trees - but generally nothing spectacularly dramatic as I had last week.\n\nI did actually try combining Gregorian and Gypsy Chimes - but these turned out to be incompatible, together producing a chaotic discordant gibberish, and I deleted the two recordings I made with that combination - but fortunately I then went on to make the best of what I had taken out this day, and the resultant recordings have turned out quite beautifully, with a nice background sound from the River Teign far below, and the periodic larger gusts of wind coming through the trees having a lovely detail of sound and helping to give the soundscape a particularly three-dimensional quality.\n\nThis recording is of the Music of the Spheres Gypsy Soprano and Mezzo chimes. As remarked for my November recordings of this combination, at a distance these chimes sound remarkably like some haunting ghostly organ playing. I deliberately placed them at a reasonable distance from the recorder to get a bit more of that effect.\n\nOne curious thing is that the Gypsy chimes (only) at this particular spot on this particular day produced an odd non-musical tapping sound at each strike of the tubes on the central 'striker' - something very apparent in this recording. I had not heard that sound in my previous recordings of these chimes, including those made with the Gypsy Chimes hanging on the very same branches last week - really quite weird, and I'm baffled as to the cause of that.\n\nBoth the Gypsy sets were doing that, but not the Gregorian chimes, and also my afternoon recording of the Gypsy Soprano chimes down below, by the River Teign, did not produce that tapping sound at all. Just maybe - I wonder if this was a temperature thing, and the air temperature of about 4 degrees C in this high position was just low enough to change the physical properties of those chimes' strikers to cause that tapping sound.\n\nThis is a 5-minute excerpt from the 32+ minutes full recording.\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/recording-nr-top-of-woods-above-fingle-bridge.jpg\">\n<i>This photo shows my recording studio for this occasion, but taken the previous week during my gale sequence - almost at the top of the north side of the Teign Gorge, and facing obliquely over the valley, so that the gusts of wind come from the right and then some come swirling around here before they continue across or down into the valley as they will. The sets of chimes visible are the Gypsy Mezzo (left, and further away) and the Pluto (right, not used this time).\nNote that the former being further away is not a bit of carelessness of mine, but a quite deliberate placement. I learnt from my first Gypsy Chimes recordings (back in November) that for best results they need to be placed further from the microphones than the Woodstock or bamboo chimes (at least, those that I have), on account of their more penetrating and potentially overpowering tone.</i><br>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/track-high-above-fingle-bridge.jpg\">\n<i>Looking the other way from near the top of the track ascending from Fingle Bridge, which latter is hidden way down below. The recorder is about 15 metres behind me, just a little down the slope from this track.</i>\n\nRecording made with a Sony PCM-M10 on a Velbon mini-tripod, using the built-in microphones covered with a Rode Dead Kitten windshield. I have used Audacity to apply a custom EQ profile to correct for the high frequency muffling caused by the windshield.\n\n<b>Please note that only very good speakers / headphones with a very extended and flat frequency response will do this recording real justice.  Please also note that the volume level of this recording has been carefully adjusted for listening purposes, and ALL my recordings so far are meant to be listened to with a volume setting that would give a realistic level for playback of CLASSICAL music (a large but not exceptional symphony orchestra).

Woodstock Chimes of Pluto</b> (tuned to a sunny-sounding pentatonic scale)\n\n<b>2. Woodstock Gregorian Chimes (tenor)</b> (tuned to a bright-sounding Gregorian chant scale)\n\n<b>3. Bamboo chimes, large and small set</b> (rather indeterminate tuning, with a touch of whole-tone scale &#8212; bought cheaply at local store)\n\nI made this recording on 21 November 2012 in a secluded position at Sharp Tor, by the Hunter's Path, high up on north side of the Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK.\n\nOnce you've listened to this, just listen to the two following uploads here, with their jaw-dropping transformation of this recording in my Nature-Symphonies 9 and 9a!\n\n<img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/121121_recording_wind_chimes_on_sharp_tor,_teign_gorge_01.jpg\" alt=\"A previous recording in this session taking place\">\n<i>A previous recording in this session taking place, using the bamboo and Pluto (metal) chimes; the small bamboo chimes are difficult to see, just behind and lower than the Pluto (metal) chimes, and its tubes are black to confuse us all. Now try to spot the recorder, on its tiny tripod (with black furry windshield)&#8230;!</i>\n\n<b>Techie stuff:</b>\n\nThe recorder was Sony PCM-M10, with Rycote Mini Windjammer. It was set up on a Hama Mini tripod, which I regard as not just 'mini' but tiny. Although I fairly quickly learned subsequently to avoid having recorders so close to the ground (distorts the frequency spectrum and tends to overemphasize lower parts of the frequency range), actually in this situation it was necessary to have the recorder really low down, where the wind was much lighter.\n\nPost-recording processing was to apply EQ in Audacity to correct for the muffling effect of the windshield &#8212; and then more recently stereo widening / sharpening-up using the VST plugin A1 Stereo Control (160% widening).\n\n<b>Please remember to give this recording a rating &#8212; Thank you!</b>&#160; <img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\">",

This is pure natural wind sounds (no layering, no post-processing, no synthesizers). Originally recorded at 24 bit Sony DAT TCD-D7 on a Sony ECM-909 microphone.

        "description": "On 18th February 2013 I took out with me a large and a small set of cheap bamboo chimes and three sets of quality metal wind chimes, to my regular field recording location for wind chimes - the Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK. This time, however, a brisk and fairly cold south-easterly wind drove me away from spots that would have been suitable on previous occasions, and this time eventually I settled for Hunter's Tor, a south-running rather rocky crest and spur that bounds the north side of the west end of the Teign Gorge.\n\nThis was about half the height from the valley bottom as compared with my previous recording spots here, and a result of this was that my recordings here got more bird sound, which was an improvement.\n\nHowever, the spot still turned out not to be ideal, in that, for a start, the recording was picking up some unwanted sounds from the fringing countryside. A distant cockerel belonging to one of the farm cottages down among the woods out to the west (straight ahead in the recording) kept crowing, and there was some power saw activity at times far away to the south. For the most part I removed parts of my recordings here in which the power saw was audible, though I think there is still a trace of it buried in a few of the noisier parts where the chimes were very active.\n\nAs for the cockerel, although I didn't really want it, I had little option but to accept it as 'part of the scenery'. Also, the wind gusts were sometimes a bit too strong against the recorder, so that, despite its windshield, the microphone wind noise became a bit overpowering - albeit quite briefly. This was primarily the case for this particular recording - my first one at this spot - because I had the recorder in a position that caught the wind just a little more.\n\n- Well, that was my initial impression, but upon subsequent listening through my hi-fi system I have considerably up-rated my assessment of this recording. Yes, some wind gusts are strong, but definitely within my limits of acceptability, and they simply give a greatly exhilarating effect. The sound of these particular chimes themselves is truly beautiful to my ears, at least in this setting, even though their sound is a dry staccato with no obvious 'sustain'. \n\n<i>Indeed, I find the full 26-minute recording unsatisfyingly SHORT</i>, and I feel a certain regret at not having continued the recording to about 40 minutes!  I note the relative lack of interest in my bamboo-only chimes recordings by visitors to my Freesound pages, and that is a pity, because they are missing something very beautiful because of the preconceptions they evidently have about bamboo chimes sound.\n\nI hung the chimes on small low branches of a particular well situated stunted tree, and had the recorder facing west, so that the fairly distant rushing sound of the River Teign well below was to the left. However, that sound is also combined with a general distant rushing sound of wind in the trees on the valley slopes - which is why its volume does vary during the recordings.\n\nThis recording is of the bamboo Chimes only - both large and small sets. It is a 5-minute excerpt from the 26 minutes full recording.\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/recording-chimes-5-sets-hunters-tor-130218-1.jpg\">\n<i>This photo shows my high-level recording studio for this particular day - on Hunter's Tor. The sets of chimes visible are the bamboo chimes, Chimes of Pluto, and Gypsy Chimes (Soprano and Mezzo). In this recording only the bamboo chimes were used (hanging at the same positions as shown), but the recorder was a bit further from them, on the left hand side of the track that you see in the foreground, and that meant, as already noted, that it was picking up a bit more wind than it was in the photographed position.</i>\n\nRecording made with a Sony PCM-M10 on a Velbon Mini Tripod, using the built-in microphones covered with a Rode Dead Kitten windshield. I have used a graphic EQ profile in Audacity to compensate for the slight muffling of the sound caused by the windshield. <b><i>I caution that the wind noise in the microphones is bound to sound too intrusive when this recording is played back through speakers / headphones that are prone to boominess; good quality hi-fi speakers with extended and flat bass response are really needed for any of these recordings really to sound right.</i></b>\n\nPlease note that the volume level of this recording has been carefully adjusted for listening purposes, and ALL my recordings so far are meant to be listened to with a volume setting that would give a realistic level for playback of CLASSICAL music (a large but not exceptional symphony orchestra). If you have the right volume setting, you should not need to change that setting from one recording of mine to another.\n<p><i>(Later note: This recording - with better sound than here - is one of my CD-quality downloads, and can be found in <a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">my e-Store</a>.)</i></p>\n<p><b>Please remember to give this recording a rating! <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\"></b></p>",

        "description": "Recording made on 14th November 2012 with a Sony PCM-M10 on a Hama mini-tripod, using the built-in microphones covered with a Rycote Mini Windjammer. I have used a graphic EQ profile in WavePad to compensate for the slight muffling of the sound caused by the Windjammer. I also applied a 3dB reduction to low bass frequencies, to render the wind noise in the microphones a bit less 'heavy'.\n\nOn 14th November 2012 I took out with me three sets of Woodstock wind chimes, with the intent to record about 20 minutes of each solo, and a full half-hour of each of the four possible combinations of these. Because of the likely interruptions through people passing by along the track, plus intrusions from aeroplanes, I aimed to record for longer than the target duration each time, to allow for cutting bits out - as indeed I had to quite a lot. I hung the chimes on small low branches of a particular well situated stunted tree by the Hunter's Path overlooking the over-steepened valley (popularly known as the Teign Gorge, though it is not actually a gorge) in the vicinity of Sharp Tor, very near Castle Drogo.  There is thus a constant quiet background of rushing water far below.\n\nThis recording is of the tenor-pitched Gregorian Chimes together with the smaller and thus higher-pitched Chimes of Pluto. The Gregorian chimes are tuned to a Gregorian chant scale, while the Pluto chimes are tuned to a very sweet sounding pentatonic scale, and thus there is an intriguing interaction between the two sound worlds, which helps to keep one's attention rather than send one to sleep. \n\nThis 5-minute excerpt is from from the 29+ minutes full recording.\n\nThe photo below is of the actual tree used for this recording, with the recorder on the mini-tripod just visible rather awkwardly astride the base of a branch. The photo actually shows the setup for the previous week's recording of the Pluto chimes, and the setup for this recording differs only in that I had the chimes on branches directly overlooking the valley slope (i.e. on the left in this view), and the recorder was in the same position except, unsurprisingly, pointing across the valley (i.e. again, to the left in this view).\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/chimes-pluto-hunters-path-299x355.jpg\">\n\nPlease note that the volume level of this recording has been carefully adjusted for listening purposes, and ALL my recordings so far are meant to be listened to with a volume setting that would give a realistic level for playback of CLASSICAL music (a large but not exceptional symphony orchestra).

        "description": "This is the second and shorter of two additional recordings made with a second recorder, while my two consecutive 'main' chimes recordings were taking place at this spot.\n\nOn 5th March 2013 I took out with me a large and a small set of cheap bamboo chimes and three sets of quality metal wind chimes, to my regular field recording location for wind chimes - the Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK. On this occasion, for the first hour of my walk-in from Drewsteignton, I was greeted by unexpected lack of wind altogether.\n\nFine for recording birds, but not for the chimes! Then, rather resigning myself to recording birds-only, and to my chimes being just a tiresome dead-weight, out on the long mostly open and relatively level stretch of the Hunter's Path, high up on the north side of the steep sided valley, I noticed a particular nicely situated stunted oak tree that seemed to be beckoning me, pointing out to me that it had a nice arrangement of suitable branches, which would enable me to get the right balance between the different sets of chimes. All very well, but of course just for noting to use another time, for right now I'd look silly trying to record chimes with no wind!\n\n\u2014 Well, except that just that moment breaths of wind started coming on, just enough to make twigs move. And so it was that I set up here, with the wind gradually getting up and actually giving me a lovely performance from the chimes after all.\n\nAs already noted, this is the second and indeed much the shorter of the two 'distant' recordings in this particular recording session, and for this, again, I used a Joby GorillaPod to seat the recorder on a tree branch on the same (downhill) side of the Hunter's Path as the chimes, somewhat further along, so probably about 50 metres from the 'main' chimes recorder position.\n\nI had moved on to this position particularly as the birds didn't seem to be sounding very much any longer nearer the chimes, but were still more vocal here, where there was almost a copse of trees. However, to my disappointment, by the time I had set this recording going, quite a bit of wind came, but very little bird sound. However, that is not the whole story. The particular trees at this spot, including the one kindly hosting the recorder, still were carrying quite a lot of their old dead leaves, which rustled and drily rattled as the wind gusts came through. At the time I thought this was probably rather a wasted recording.\n\nIn the event, from my later perspective back at home, this seems to me to be at least one of the nicest recordings I obtained that day. The sound of the dead leaves gives a really beautiful impression of the wind, and the Gypsy chimes can be heard faintly, coming in and out of focus, and this is the mysterious, intensely melancholy and even 'ghostly' sound that I had for some time been intending to capture from those Gypsy chimes. My only regret now is that I didn't let this recording run for at least a full half hour.\n\nThe chimes used are bamboo chimes, large and small set (imprecisely tuned to a semblance of the whole tone scale), and Music of the Spheres Gypsy Chimes, Mezzo and Soprano sizes (tuned to a troubled and melancholy-sounding Eastern European Gypsy scale). However, really only the Gypsy chimes are heard from this far away, at least to any significant extent.\n\nThis is a 5-minute excerpt from the 10+ minutes' recording.\n\n<i>This photo shows the second of the 'main' recordings taking place. Note the placement of the Gypsy chimes distinctly further back than the bamboo chimes, and the recorder fairly well back from them all in order to get a good balance. This lot was actually hidden from the position of the distant recording described here.</i>\n\nRecording made with a Sony PCM-M10 on a Joby GorillaPod, using the built-in microphones covered with a Rode Dead Kitten windshield. I have used Audacity to apply a custom EQ profile to correct for the high frequency muffling caused by the windshield, and also to correct for an audible 'hump' in the lower bass frequencies, which I get in ALL my recordings prior to processing.\n\n<i>(Later note: This recording - with better sound than here - is one of my CD-quality downloads, and can be found in <a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">my e-Store</a>.)</i>\n<p><b>Please remember to give this recording a rating! <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\"></b></p>",

Haunting 'suspended in mid-air' sounds from two bamboo and three metal wind chimes, quite exposed on the narrow Hunter's Tor ridge at the west end of the Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK. The cathedral acoustic is distance+2; at this level of distance the effect is getting really striking, and light-years away from Hunter's Tor in the Teign Gorge!</b>\n\n<b>Chimes used:</b>\n\n<b>Music of the Spheres Gypsy Mezzo</b> (eastern European Gypsy scale, lower)\n\n<b>Music of the Spheres Gypsy Soprano</b> (eastern European Gypsy scale, higher)\n\n<b>Woodstock Chimes of Pluto</b> (pentatonic, middling-high)\n\n<b>Bamboo, large and small set</b> (purchased cheaply from local store)\n\nI made this recording on 18 February 2013 following a recording of bamboo chimes only (<a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/Philip_Goddard/sounds/700526/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://freesound.org/people/Philip_Goddard/sounds/700526/</a> ).\n\n<b>A 'crazy' experiment \u2014 put it in a cathedral!</b>\n\nWhen I came to produce this half-speed version (i.e., the original version without any added reverb) I noticed that the background sounds (primarily the River Teign down below and indeed the wind) were hardly noticeable. I soon got the notion to see if I could get usefully interesting results from producing versions of this half-speed version given a <b>cathedral acoustic</b> \u2014 producing versions that placed the chimes ensemble at a range of distances within the cathedral perspective.\n\nThat I've now done, and this is the third of four 'cathedral' versions of that, ranging from 'close' to 'distance+3' \u2014 the latter sounding quite freaky, though to my no doubt warped senses, still compellingly beautiful in its own way. The greater the distance, the more the metal chimes sound like a spooky distant organ.\n\n<img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/130218_recording_wind_chimes_at_hunter%27s_tor,_teign_gorge_02.jpg\" alt=\"This recording taking place\">\n<i>This recording taking place. The two nearest and apparently higher chimes are the bamboo ones, the rightmost one is the Pluto chimes, and the other two (more distant, with black tubes) are the Gypsy chimes.</i>\n \n<b>Techie stuff</b>\n\nThe recorder was Sony PCM-M10, with R&#248;de DeadKitten furry windshield (original, more effective, version), placed on a Velbon Mini tripod.\n\nPost-recording processing was to apply EQ in Audacity to correct for the  muffling effect of the windshield, and more recent processing with the A1 Stereo Control VST plugin (160% widening). I used the 'Change speed' effect in Audacity to produce this half-speed version. The cathedral effect was produced by the VST plugin Oril River, which is the best free reverb I've so far found, at least for anything that I myself would be doing; I used custom variants of the 'Cathedral 2' factory preset.\n\n<b>Please remember to give this recording a rating &#8212; Thank you! <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\"></b>",

The two nearest and apparently higher chimes are the bamboo ones, the rightmost one is the Pluto chimes, and the other two (further back, with black tubes) are the Gypsy chimes.</i>\n \n<b>Techie stuff</b>\n\nThe recorder was Sony PCM-M10, with R&#248;de DeadKitten furry windshield (original, more effective, version), placed on a Velbon Mini tripod. \n\nPost-recording processing was to apply EQ in Audacity to correct for the  muffling effect of the windshield, and more recent processing with the A1 Stereo Control VST plugin (160% widening).\n\n<b>Please remember to give this recording a rating &#8212; Thank you! <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\"></b>",

        "description": "On 28th November 2012 I took out with me a large and a small set of cheap bamboo chimes and two sets of Music of the Spheres Gypsy (quality, metal) wind chimes - the Soprano and Mezzo sizes, the sounds of which latter two mesh together beautifully. My intention was to hang the chimes on the same tree that I had used for my recordings a week earlier, at Sharp Tor, by the Hunter's Path, high up on the north side of the over-steepened part of the River Teign valley known as the Teign Gorge, Devon, UK.\n\nIn the event the wind, being from a north-easterly direction this time, was not sufficiently reaching anywhere along there, and I finally reluctantly went higher up on the slope, almost to the top, where a chilly breeze was coming over and moving the tree branches a bit. I hung the chimes on one tree and made this recording, but after nearly 10 minutes of rather modest activity the wind got up more and then appeared to be too continuously on the strong side, so I then moved to a nearby tree that was not catching the wind so strongly, to make the further recordings, including a repeat of this recordings' combination of chimes.\n\nBeing this high up was not ideal, for the sound of the River Teign in the valley bottom, although still audible, is heard only indirectly and faintly, so, when listening to the recording, it is difficult to tell what is the nature of the very faint continuous roar in the background. Also, here I was very close to the grazed pasture that covers the broad top of the hill, and a result of this is that all this day's recordings are punctuated by faint moos from distant cattle that were far away and out of sight.\n\nThis recording is of the two sets of bamboo chimes, which I had purchased locally in Exeter for just a few pounds each, plus the Music of the Spheres Gypsy Chimes, Soprano and Mezzo sizes. The refined ethereal, 'liquid' tone and precise tuning of these metal Music of the Spheres chimes contrast beautifully with the dry, earthy rattlings, clatterings and 'donkings' of the bamboo chimes. Indeed, these Gypsy chimes, with their particular timbre and tuning to some sort of Eastern European scale, sound at a distance like some ghostly organ playing. People who passed by while I was making recordings with these chimes tended spontaneously to use the words 'haunting' and 'magical'.\n\nThis is a 5-minute excerpt from the 25+ minutes full recording. In the latter, up to nearly 10 minutes in, the activity is very gentle and slow, giving a haunting and quite eerie prelude to the considerable activity that follows on once the wind gets up. This excerpt covers the final bit of that quiet 'prelude', then leading on into a short portion of the 'action'.\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/chimes-bamboo-gypsy-mezzo-recording-above-teign-gorge-450x405.jpg\">\n<i>This photo shows my recording studio for 28th November 2012 - almost at the top of the north side of the Teign Gorge, and facing obliquely away from it. The sets of chimes visible are the large and small bamboo, with the Gypsy Mezzo in the middle.\nNote that actually this was a first time learning experience for me with the Gypsy chimes, and actually for best effects the Gypsy chimes needed to be about twice the distance from the recorder than I actually used on this particular day, on account of their having a stronger and more penetrating tone than my other chimes.</i>\n\nRecording made with a Sony PCM-M10 on a Hama mini-tripod, using the built-in microphones covered with a Rycote Mini Windjammer. I have used a graphic EQ profile in WavePad to compensate for the slight muffling of the sound caused by the Windjammer.\n\n<b><i>I caution that the wind noise in the microphones is bound to sound too intrusive when this recording is played back through speakers / headphones that are prone to boominess; good quality hi-fi speakers with extended and flat bass response are really needed for any of these recordings really to sound right.</i></b>\n\nPlease also note that the volume level of this recording has been carefully adjusted for listening purposes, and ALL my recordings so far are meant to be listened to with a volume setting that would give a realistic level for playback of CLASSICAL music (a large but not exceptional symphony orchestra). If you have the right volume setting, you should not need to change that setting from one recording of mine to another.\n\nN.B. Initially I gave all this day's recordings a 3dB cut of the lower bass to somewhat lighten the sound of the wind in the microphones, and so all the excerpts here from this day's recording have that bass reduction.  However, subsequently, on careful listening, especially through my decent hi-fi speakers, I came to the conclusion that the wind noise in the microphones did not reach a level at which such processing was really necessary, and so I have subsequently restored those bass frequencies to the full recordings, with a distinct improvement in the sound as heard through my hi-fi speakers.\n<p><i>(Later note: This recording - with better sound than here - is one of my CD-quality downloads, and can be found in <a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">my e-Store</a>.)</i></p>\n<p><b>Please remember to give this recording a rating! <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\"></b></p>",

What I'm presenting here is part of a 59' recording.</b>\n\n<b>Chimes used:</b>\n\n<b>1. Davis Blanchard Debussy Bells</b> (left)\n\n<b>2. Bamboo chimes &#8212; cheap ones bought from a local store. These are a large and a small set, which I always used together as though they were one instrument.</b> (right)\n\nThis is one of the many fruits of my <i><b>Wind Chimes in the Wild</b></i> project. Perhaps perversely, I'm uploading my recordings in reverse chronological order &#8212; most recent first &#8212;, so the most 'advanced' sounds are tending to come earlier rather than later. \n\n<b><a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-2-windchimes.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Detailed information about the Davis Blanchard chimes</a></b>\n\nBirds don't figure strongly in this particular day's recordings.\n\n<img alt=\"Recording Davis Blanchard chimes just below Hunter's Gate\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/170224_recording_wind_chimes_high_up_in_teign_gorge.jpg\">\n<i>Recording two Davis Blanchard chimes plus a large and small set of cheap bamboo chimes in an earlier session at the same spot (no photos for this session). The arrow points to the recorder, with its black furry windshield.</i>\n\n<b>Techie stuff:</b>\nThe recorder was a Sony PCM-D100, with two nested furry windshields &#8212; the inner being a Movo one <b>of rectangular box shape*</b>, and the outer a custom Windcut one &#8212;, and it was placed on a mini Zipshot tripod.\n\n* <i>Note that I <strong>WARN AGAINST</strong> use of windshields that are of any sort of box shape, for I soon found that they were inherently unsuitable for any decent-quality recording. While no doubt non-box-shaped windshields from Movo would be okay, the presence of relatively flat surfaces, edges and corners creates internal narrow resonance peaks in the treble, which give the latter an abrasive and rather 'screamy' quality, no matter who's made the particular windshields.&#160; When I realized why my recordings had developed that nasty treble quality I had to go back through all recordings made with that dratted box-shaped windshield, and use Voxengo CurveEQ to enable me to precisely neutralize two narrow treble peaks and thus enable the recordings to sound wonderfully natural rather than bafflingly stressful.</i> \n\nPost-recording processing was to apply EQ in Audacity to correct for the muffling effect of the windshields and correction for the D100's weakness in very low bass &#8212; and then, later on, the aforementioned remedial EQ measure using Voxengo CurveEQ to remove the two narrow treble peaks kindly added by that rogue model of furry windshield.\n\n<b>Please remember to give this recording a rating &#8212; Thank you!</b>&#160; <img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\">",

        "description": "<b>Still more outlandishly other-worldly \u2014 half speed!</b>\n\n<b>Here we have a strange and enchanting trio, recorded on 10 May 2017 at my usual wind chimes recording spot, by Hunting Gate, at the highest point on the Hunter's Path, high up on the north side of the Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK &#8212; as always, with a backdrop of the quiet rushing sound of the River Teign far below in the bottom of the valley. This is part of <a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/Philip_Goddard/sounds/685367/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://freesound.org/people/Philip_Goddard/sounds/685367/</a>, reduced to half-speed and thus sounding an octave lower than the original.</b>\n\n<b>Chimes used:</b>\n\n<b>1. Davis Blanchard Twilight</b> (right)\n\n<b>2. Davis Blanchard The Blues</b> (left)\n\n<b>3. Bamboo chimes &#8212; cheap ones bought from a local store. These are a large and a small set, which I always used together as though they were one instrument.</b>\n\nAfter the really quite awesome musical spectacles afforded by the various clashes and microtonal interactions between other pairings of DB chimes, this pairing comes as a real surprise, for its overall sound is sweet and harmonious, with only the odd teasing hints of the odd wayward note or interval. Also, the tuning of this pair matches particularly well the bamboo chimes, so that instead of sounding to be a wayward contrasting element, the latter chimes' contrast is only in timbre and not much in the pitches being sounded, which key in together remarkably harmoniously.\n\nThe birds were singing even more for these recordings than previous times, so, together with the mostly gentle wind and thus mostly gentle chimes sound, we have a great recording of a beautiful overall balance of birds and chimes. In this half-speed version the birds sound every bit as enchanting as the chimes, and key in remarkably effectively with the chimes in a most musical manner.\n\nThis is one of the many fruits of my <i><b>Wind Chimes in the Wild</b></i> project. Perhaps perversely, I'm uploading my recordings in reverse chronological order &#8212; most recent first &#8212;, so the most 'advanced' sounds are tending to come earlier rather than later. \n\n<b><a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-2-windchimes.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Detailed information about the Davis Blanchard chimes</a></b>\n\nThe willow warbler is the most prominent and persistent bird singing for us, but there's a range of others.\n\n<img alt=\"Recording Davis Blanchard chimes just below Hunter's Gate\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/170224_recording_wind_chimes_high_up_in_teign_gorge.jpg\">\n<i>Recording two Davis Blanchard chimes plus a large and small set of cheap bamboo chimes in an earlier session at the same spot (no photos for this session). The arrow points to the recorder, with its black furry windshield.</i>\n\n<b>Techie stuff:</b>\nThe recorder was a Sony PCM-D100, with two nested Windcut furry windshields (custom design), and it was placed on a Zipshot Mini tripod, in a position where it was tolerably sheltered from the wind.\n\nInitial post-recording processing was to apply an EQ curve to compensate for muffling from the furry windshields. I used Audacity to reduce the speed of this version.\n\n<b>Please remember to give this recording a rating &#8212; Thank you!</b>&#160; <img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\">",

This is really odd, because each of the pentatonic chimes on its own, or any of them together, have a radiant sunny sort of sound, which you'd think would dispel any sadness or melancholy rather than intensify and deepen it!</b>\n\n<b>Here I used all three of my pentatonic chimes with the Olympos chimes, and the effect is disturbingly other-worldly &#8212; so beautiful, yet like a great palace of immense sadnesses (the effect is augmented in the half-speed version of this recording).

        "description": "On 6th February 2013 I took out with me to the Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK, a set of Woodstock Gregorian Tenor Chimes and two sets of Music of the Spheres Gypsy wind chimes. I was aiming for another full day's recording near the top of the woods above Fingle Bridge - and indeed I did last out for a full morning there - but then I had to pack up and flee because the air temperature was only about 4 degrees, with some wind-chill factor as well, and my hands and feet were causing me stress through being so painfully cold.\n\nI thought that I'd finished recording for the day, but got down to the much more sheltered Fisherman's Path by the River Teign at the west end of the steep-sided part of the valley, turning back downstream along that path just a little, and it was sufficiently sheltered and sunny just by a very noisy weir (with fish ladder) for me to sit on a wooden seat there and at last eat my packed lunch - my hands having warmed up by then.\n\nThen I started noticing that actually some modest gusts of wind were coming from the west along the very bottom of the valley here (the general wind direction being northerly), and so as soon as I'd finished eating I tried experimentally putting up and recording a set of chimes in a sequence of different positions beside the river just a little downstream from the weir (an even moderately close recording of the latter itself would have been too noisy for a pleasant 'listenable' recording).\n\n<img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/teign-weir-130218.jpg\">\n<i>The weir in question, photographed a couple of weeks later, with probably less than half the flow than was occurring for the current recording.</i>\n\nThis, then, and the other recordings in this particular sequence, was very much of an experiment, with a quite loud river noise and the chimes sound tending to be buried within the river sound except when wind gusts came along and made the chimes more frisky. This recording, and its other 'siblings' taken at this location, then, needs to be perceived NOT a failed chimes recording, but a recording of the river sound with chimes in the midst of it.\n\nGenerally I would want quieter river sound against the chimes, but actually I had little choice here, because when I sought to get just slightly up the slope, a little more removed from the river, I lost the wind, and so could not use the chimes there anyway. But in any case this was an interesting experiment, and I could come back here another time with more favourable wind conditions and get a more restful balance of river and chimes.\n\nThe chimes in this recording are the Woodstock Gregorian Tenor Chimes, tuned to a Gregorian chant scale, which gives them a bright and 'grand' sound.\n\nThis is a 5-minute excerpt from the 15+ minutes full recording.\n\nRecording made with a Sony PCM-M10 on a Velbon mini-tripod, using the built-in microphones covered with a Rode Dead Kitten windshield. I have used Audacity to apply a custom EQ profile to correct for the high frequency muffling caused by the windshield.\n\n<b>Please note that only very good speakers / headphones with a very extended and flat frequency response will do this recording real justice.  Please also note that the volume level of this recording has been carefully adjusted for listening purposes, and ALL my recordings so far are meant to be listened to with a volume setting that would give a realistic level for playback of CLASSICAL music (a large but not exceptional symphony orchestra). If you have the right volume setting, you should not need to change that setting from one recording of mine to another.</b>\n<br><i>(Later note: This recording - with better sound than here - is one of my CD-quality downloads, and can be found in <a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">my e-Store</a>.)</i>\n<p><b>Please remember to give this recording a rating! <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\"></b></p>",

        "description": "<b>A 'Wow!' wind chimes ensemble hung up from trees high up in the Teign Gorge &#8212; but how come it's so emotionally ambivalent? &#8212; See further below for some degree of explanation. Chimes used this time are:</b>\n\n<b>1. Woodstock Gregorian Chimes (Tenor)</b> (relatively low-pitched, a Gregorian chant scale)\n\n<b>2. Woodstock Chimes of Pluto</b> (moderately high-pitched, pentatonic)\n\n<b>3. Woodstock Chimes of Polaris</b> (higher-pitched, pentatonic)\n\n<b>4. Woodstock Chimes of Mercury</b> (very high-pitched pentatonic)\n\n<b>5. Woodstock Chimes of Mars</b> (very high-pitched and penetrating; not sure what scale!)\n\nI recorded this on 19 March 2014, on the rough slope just below Hunting Gate, which latter marks the highest point of the Hunter's Path, high up on the north side of the Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK.\n\nThe ensemble for this recording gives us an uneasy inner conflict between the pretentious and, to me, rather smug sound of the Gregorian chimes, and the greater sense of genuine purity in the three pentatonic and the Mars chimes, the latter of which inject a few 'major'-sounding notes at the top end, which adds not just brilliance at the top end but an impassioned sense of narrative.\n\nThe overall emotional effect of the apparent 'major'-scale injection is to give an <em>impassioned</em> quality to the overall sound, especially where the chimes are most active. However, with the Gregorian chimes as the 'foundation', that 'impassioned' quality seems to me quite a bit twisted, even at times verging into an unhealthy sentimentality.\n\nActually, with regard to this recording session overall, things weren't straightforward for me. For one thing, the wind wasn't really as strong as had been forecast or indeed as what I was aiming for, and indeed there really wasn't enough wind at all for what I wanted till towards midday. For this reason certain of the recordings are really 'birds with gentle wind chimes sounds (on and off)'.\n\nAlso, I didn't get the chimes balance fully as I was after &#8212; though, generally speaking, the balance was still acceptable, there being no precise right or wrong about this. And then, as part of that issue, really the small chimes were a bit closer to the recorder than would have been ideal, and this led to the non-musical tapping sound of the strikers, particularly of the Mercury and Mars chimes, being intrusively loud on occasions, and in places the diminutive Mars chimes came out really uncomfortably loud.\n\nAnother issue for me was that the sound of these combinations, although exquisitely beautiful, was musically not what I'd been expecting, and indeed in some cases (primarily involving the Gregorian chimes) was something that I wasn't keen on (as already noted, actually sounding sentimental in a weird twisted way!) &#8212; though mitigated by the overall soundscape, with so many birds pronouncing their springtime territories.\n\nFor more details about the different chimes used, please go to <b><a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-windchimes.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-windchimes.htm</a></b>.\n\n<img alt=\"Four Woodstock chimes being recorded during the same session\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/140319_recording_wind_chimes_%28several_sets%29_overlooking_teign_gorge_02.jpg\">\n<i>Recording four Woodstock chimes in this session.

Davis Blanchard Pluto</b> (right)\n\n<b>2. Davis Blanchard Twilight</b> (left)\n\nThis was one of the fruits of my final recording session in my <i><b>Wind Chimes in the Wild</b></i> project.

        "description": "Wind in the late dark evening in a residential area. The wind blows between the fences (three fences located parallel in front of me). One is close- about a meter- latticed. The other two are approximately 20 meters (wooden picket fence) and 30 meters (metal bars). Sometimes you can hear the wind rushing in between them and starting its magic. You can also hear him making noises in the bushes and trees. Evening traffic can be heard in the background. I've already recorded at this place in the fall <a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/sounds/760434/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/sounds/760434/</a> . But it's funny, I've never done them there in winter, even though I walk there almost every day. Apparently, in the near future, it will become a favorite place. It's very beautiful to hear it live. I hope you enjoy it.\nRecorded December 27, 2024 on Tascam DR-05x with post processing.\nLocation: Ekaterinburg (Russia).\nI ask you, if possible, to help this wonderful site (not me) stay afloat and develop further.

        "description": "On 6th February 2013 I took out with me to the Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK, a set of Woodstock Gregorian Tenor Chimes and two sets of Music of the Spheres Gypsy wind chimes. I was aiming for another full day's recording near the top of the woods above Fingle Bridge - and indeed I did last out for a full morning there - but then I had to pack up and flee because the air temperature was only about 4 degrees, with some wind-chill factor as well, and my hands and feet were causing me stress through being so painfully cold.\n\nI thought that I'd finished recording for the day, but got down to the much more sheltered Fisherman's Path by the River Teign at the west end of the steep-sided part of the valley, turning back downstream along that path just a little, and it was sufficiently sheltered and sunny just by a very noisy weir (with fish ladder) for me to sit on a wooden seat there and at last eat my packed lunch - my hands having warmed up by then.\n\nThen I started noticing that actually some modest gusts of wind were coming from the west along the very bottom of the valley here (the general wind direction being northerly), and so as soon as I'd finished eating I tried experimentally putting up and recording a set of chimes in a sequence of different positions beside the river just a little downstream from the weir (an even moderately close recording of the latter itself would have been too noisy for a pleasant 'listenable' recording).\n\n<img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/teign-weir-130218.jpg\">\n<i>The weir in question, photographed a couple of weeks later, with probably less than half the flow than was occurring for the current recording.</i>\n\nThis, then, and the other recordings in this particular sequence, was very much of an experiment, with a quite loud river noise and the chimes sound tending to be buried within the river sound except when wind gusts came along and made the chimes more frisky. This recording, and its other 'siblings' taken at this location, then, needs to be perceived NOT a failed chimes recording, but a recording of the river sound with chimes in the midst of it. This particular recording is particularly white-noisy because it was closer to the weir than some of the others.\n\nGenerally I'd want quieter river sound against the chimes, but actually I had little choice here, because when I sought to get just slightly up the slope, a little more removed from the river, I lost the wind, and so could not use the chimes there anyway. But in any case this was an interesting experiment, and I could come back here another time with more favourable wind conditions and get a more restful balance of river and chimes.\n\nThe chimes in this recording are the Woodstock Gregorian Tenor Chimes, tuned to a Gregorian chant scale, which gives them a bright and 'grand' sound.\n\nThis is a 5-minute excerpt from the 14+ minutes full recording.\n\nRecording made with a Sony PCM-M10 on a Velbon mini-tripod, using the built-in microphones covered with a Rode Dead Kitten windshield. I have used Audacity to apply a custom EQ profile to correct for the high frequency muffling caused by the windshield.\n\n<b>Please note that only very good speakers / headphones with a very extended and flat frequency response will do this recording real justice.  Please also note that the volume level of this recording has been carefully adjusted for listening purposes, and ALL my recordings so far are meant to be listened to with a volume setting that would give a realistic level for playback of CLASSICAL music (a large but not exceptional symphony orchestra). If you have the right volume setting, you should not need to change that setting from one recording of mine to another.</b>\n<p><i>(Later note: This recording - with better sound than here - is one of my CD-quality downloads, and can be found in <a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">my e-Store</a>.)</i></p>\n<p><b>Please remember to give this recording a rating! <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\"></b></p>",

        "description": "<b>A candidate here for 'ULTIMATE Outlandish Chimes Ensemble' designation! &#8212; Outlandishly other-worldly!</b>\n\n<b>This is a half-speed (thus an octave lower-pitched) rendering of part of <a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/Philip_Goddard/sounds/681722/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://freesound.org/people/Philip_Goddard/sounds/681722/</a> . To help maintain interest, for this half-speed version I shortened the long quiescent period following the sqally light shower.</b>\n\n<b>If this is unbearable for you in its dissonance, please take heart that this is a particularly extreme example, requiring a lot of mental flexibility to appreciate, and all other chimes combinations that I'd upload here would not go <i>this</i> far in dissonance!</b>\n\n<b>Here we have another weird trio, recorded on 10 May 2018 at my usual wind chimes recording spot, by Hunting Gate, at the highest point on the Hunter's Path, high up on the north side of the Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK &#8212; as always, with a backdrop of the quiet rushing sound of the River Teign far below in the bottom of the valley.</b>\n\n<b>Chimes used:</b>\n\n<b>1. Davis Blanchard Pluto</b>\n\n<b>2. David Blanchard Twilight</b>\n\n<b>3. Music of the Spheres Gypsy Soprano</b>\n\nThis was one of the fruits of my final recording in the <i><b>Wind Chimes in the Wild</b></i> project. Perhaps perversely, I'm uploading my recordings in reverse chronological order &#8212; most recent first &#8212;, so the most 'advanced' sounds are tending to come earlier rather than later. Because of its challenging nature I chose to restrict this upload to the first 35' of the 93-minute full recording.\n\nWeirdly, just as happened for the previous outlandish chimes ensemble trio recording (26 April 2018), early on we have a quite long episode in which the wind gets up and leads into a light shower, all sounding really dramatic &#8212; then again followed by a period of quiescence with just faint wisps of chimes sound before the wind and chimes return to 'business as (un)usual'.\n\nActually overall this recording has a rather rougher and wilder feel about it than that previous recording, because (a) the tuning mismatch between Twilight and Gypsy chimes is particularly marked, often causing a lot of shimmering 'beats' in the sound, which have an intriguing beauty but wouldn't please all ears, and (b) the wind was really not quite in the right direction this time, and the recording suffered from a lot of intrusive microphone wind noise, which took a lot of work to remove the worst of. Inevitably, then, I had to allow in more microphone wind noise than I wanted to, just cutting out its (many) more intrusive occurrences.\n\nNonetheless, this is a sound that is by turns thrilling and, during quiescence, hauntingly will-o'-the-wispish, suspended over the Teign Gorge soundscape with rushing of the River Teign far below and the spring birdsong coming and going all around.\n\nPositioning is Twilight (L.), Gypsy (R. of centre), placed further back, and Pluto (R.). I wanted the Gypsy to be dead centre, but I was limited by the position of a suitable branch to hang it on.\n\n<b><a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-2-windchimes.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">General information about the Davis Blanchard chimes</a></b>\n\n<b><a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-windchimes.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">General information about the Music of the Spheres and Woodstock chimes</a></b>\n\nBirds heard in the full recording include Blue Tit, Chaffinch, Chiffchaff, Linnet, Mistle thrush, Blackbird, Carrion crow, Yellowhammer, Blackcap, Wren, Willow warbler.\n\n<img alt=\"Recording Davis Blanchard chimes just below Hunting Gate\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/170224_recording_wind_chimes_high_up_in_teign_gorge.jpg\">\n<i>Recording two Davis Blanchard chimes plus a large and small set of cheap bamboo chimes in an earlier session at the same spot (no photos for this session).

        "description": "<b>Even more outlandishly other-worldly in this half-speed version of the chimes-priority condensate!</b>\n\n<b>Here we have an outlandish trio, recorded on 26 April 2017 at my usual wind chimes recording spot, by Hunting Gate, at the highest point on the Hunter's Path, high up on the north side of the Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK &#8212; as always, with a backdrop of the quiet rushing sound of the River Teign far below in the bottom of the valley.</b>\n\n<b>A unique and thrilling musical / aesthetic experience, this time often with less wind and therefore less chimes activity than I was aiming for, but at least a good amount of bird sound, albeit mostly more or less distant.\n\nAs with other ensembles in this series of Davis Blanchard chimes, the pairing of the particular chimes can sound initially discordant, but then that sense of discord rapidly dissipates as a cornucopia of wonderful musical interactions between the chimes unfolds. There is something in the haunting overall sound that seems to be telling a story of some urgency.</b>\n\n<b>Chimes used:</b>\n\n<b>1. Davis Blanchard Pluto</b> (left)\n\n<b>2. Davis Blanchard The Blues</b> (right)\n\n<b>3. Bamboo chimes &#8212; cheap ones bought from a local store. These are a large and a small set, which I always used together as though they were one instrument.</b>I'm presenting here two CD-length condensates from the 4-hour-plus final edited recording from that session.\n\nThis condensate gives priority to the chimes, and here we have the half-speed version of it, while the other condensate gives priority to the birds.\n\nThis is one of the many fruits of my <i><b>Wind Chimes in the Wild</b></i> project. Perhaps perversely, I'm uploading my recordings in reverse chronological order &#8212; most recent first &#8212;, so the most 'advanced' sounds are tending to come earlier rather than later. \n\n<b><a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-2-windchimes.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Detailed information about the Davis Blanchard chimes</a></b>\n\nChaffinch, chiffchaff and willow warbler are the most prominent and persistent birds singing for us, but there's a range of others. Also, often passing flies in the foreground (mostly hoverflies) give an additional sense of joyful springtime energy.\n\n<img alt=\"Recording Davis Blanchard chimes just below Hunter's Gate\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/170224_recording_wind_chimes_high_up_in_teign_gorge.jpg\">\n<i>Recording two Davis Blanchard chimes plus a large and small set of cheap bamboo chimes in an earlier session at the same spot (no photos for this session).

        "description": "On 28th November 2012 I took out with me a large and a small set of cheap bamboo chimes and two sets of Music of the Spheres Gypsy (quality, metal) wind chimes - the Soprano and Mezzo sizes, the sounds of which latter two mesh together beautifully. My intention was to hang the chimes on the same tree that I had used for my recordings a week earlier, at Sharp Tor, by the Hunter's Path, high up on the north side of the over-steepened part of the River Teign valley known as the Teign Gorge, Devon, UK.\n\nIn the event the wind, being from a north-easterly direction this time, was not sufficiently reaching anywhere along there, and I finally reluctantly went higher up on the slope, almost to the top, where a chilly breeze was coming over and moving the tree branches a bit. I hung the chimes on one tree and made one recording, but after nearly 10 minutes of rather modest activity the wind got up more and then appeared to be too continuously on the strong side, so I then moved to a nearby tree that was not catching the wind so strongly, to make this and the further recordings - this recording being a repeat of the previous recording's combination of chimes.\n\nBeing this high up was not ideal, for the sound of the River Teign in the valley bottom, although still audible, is heard only indirectly and faintly, so, when listening to the recording, it is difficult to tell what is the nature of the very faint continuous roar in the background. Also, here I was very close to the grazed pasture that covers the broad top of the hill, and a result of this is that all this day's recordings are punctuated by faint moos from distant cattle that were far away and out of sight.\n\nThis recording is of the two sets of bamboo chimes, which I had purchased locally in Exeter for just a few pounds each, plus the Music of the Spheres Gypsy Chimes, Soprano and Mezzo sizes. The refined ethereal, 'liquid' tone and precise tuning of these metal Music of the Spheres chimes contrast beautifully with the dry, earthy rattlings, clatterings and 'donkings' of the bamboo chimes. Indeed, these Gypsy chimes, with their particular timbre and tuning to some sort of Eastern European scale, sound at a distance like some ghostly organ playing. People who passed by while I was making recordings with these chimes tended spontaneously to use the words 'haunting' and 'magical'.\n\nThis is a 5-minute excerpt from the 26+ minutes full recording.\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/chimes-bamboo-gypsy-mezzo-recording-above-teign-gorge-450x405.jpg\">\n<i>This photo shows my recording studio for 28th November 2012 - almost at the top of the north side of the Teign Gorge, and facing obliquely away from it. The sets of chimes visible are the large and small bamboo, with the Gypsy Mezzo in the middle.\nNote that actually this was a first time learning experience for me with the Gypsy chimes, and actually for best effects the Gypsy chimes needed to be about twice the distance from the recorder than I actually used on this particular day, on account of their having a stronger and more penetrating tone than my other chimes.</i>\n\nRecording made with a Sony PCM-M10 on a Hama mini-tripod, using the built-in microphones covered with a Rycote Mini Windjammer. I have used a graphic EQ profile in WavePad to compensate for the slight muffling of the sound caused by the Windjammer.\n\n<b><i>I caution that the wind noise in the microphones is bound to sound too intrusive when this recording is played back through speakers / headphones that are prone to boominess; good quality hi-fi speakers with extended and flat bass response are really needed for any of these recordings really to sound right.</i></b>\n\nPlease also note that the volume level of this recording has been carefully adjusted for listening purposes, and ALL my recordings so far are meant to be listened to with a volume setting that would give a realistic level for playback of CLASSICAL music (a large but not exceptional symphony orchestra). If you have the right volume setting, you should not need to change that setting from one recording of mine to another.\n\nN.B. Initially I gave all this day's recordings a 3dB cut of the lower bass to somewhat lighten the sound of the wind in the microphones, and so all the excerpts here from this day's recording have that bass reduction.  However, subsequently, on careful listening, especially through my decent hi-fi speakers, I came to the conclusion that the wind noise in the microphones did not reach a level at which such processing was really necessary, and so I have subsequently restored those bass frequencies to the full recordings, with a distinct improvement in the sound as heard through my hi-fi speakers.\n<p><i>(Later note: This recording - with better sound than here - is one of my CD-quality downloads, and can be found in <a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">my e-Store</a>.)</i></p>\n<p><b>Please remember to give this recording a rating! <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\"></b></p>",

Some are stagnant or static and with few birds.\nThe presents of the colourful red and yellow dry leaves that is still on the trees, creates the noise of the wind with rustling whispers.\nIs a constantly form of natural white noise that is always changing and evolving. These recordings is from my third attempt.\nI think it is very difficult to record the \u201cspirit\u201d and unique sound of the wind. This is pure natural wind sounds (no layering, no post-processing, no synthesizers). Originally recorded at 24 bit Sony DAT TCD-D7 on a Sony ECM-909 microphone. Recorded in Sweden September of 2007 in a wet cold beautiful colourful forest, with all kind of trees, far away from any traffic or human sounds.",

Davis Blanchard Pluto</b> (right)\n\n<b>2. Davis Blanchard Twilight</b> (left)\n\n<b><i>(My apologies \u2014 I omitted to fade-out the ending! I didn't at all mean a sudden ending like that!)</i></b>\n\nThis was one of the fruits of my final recording session in my <i><b>Wind Chimes in the Wild</b></i> project. Perhaps perversely, I'm uploading my recordings in reverse chronological order &#8212; most recent first &#8212;, so the most 'advanced' sounds are tending to come earlier rather than later.\n\nI was actually doubtful about sharing this particular half-speed version, because it's come out with pronounced mic hiss, no doubt caused by the EQ used to compensate for the muffling caused by the three nested furry windshields used. I finally decided to share it anyway so that people can hear these wonderful sounds and maybe find some inspiration in them. I've done what I can sensibly do to minimize that hiss.\n\n<b><a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-2-windchimes.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">General information about the Davis Blanchard chimes</a></b>\n\n<b><a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-windchimes.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">General information about the Music of the Spheres and Woodstock chimes</a></b>\n\nBirds heard include Chiffchaff, Blue tit, Wood pigeon, Raven, Willow warbler, chaffinch (calls) &#8212; and the odd friendly bumblebee coming fussing around.\n\n<img alt=\"Recording Davis Blanchard chimes just below Hunter's Gate\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/170224_recording_wind_chimes_high_up_in_teign_gorge.jpg\">\n<i>Recording two Davis Blanchard chimes plus a large and small set of cheap bamboo chimes in an earlier session at the same spot (no photos for this session). The arrow points to the recorder, with its black furry windshield.</i>\n\n<b>Techie stuff:</b>\nThe recorder was a Sony PCM-D100, with three nested Windcut furry windshields (custom design), and it was placed on a Zipshot Mini tripod, in a position where it was tolerably sheltered from the wind.\n\nInitial post-recording processing was to apply an EQ curve to compensate for muffling from the furry windshields. I used Audacity's Change Speed effect function to produce this half-speed version.\n\n<b>Please remember to give this recording a rating &#8212; Thank you!</b>&#160; <img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\">",

        "description": "A real 'Wow!' wind chimes ensemble hung up from trees high up in the Teign Gorge:\n\n<b>1. Woodstock Chimes of Olympos</b> (relatively low-pitched Ancient Greek scale)\n\n<b>2. Woodstock Chimes of Polaris</b> (high-pitched pentatonic)\n\n<b>3. Woodstock Chimes of Mars</b> (high-pitched, not sure what scale, but different from all the others)\n\n<b>4. Woodstock Chimes of Mercury</b> (very high-pitched pentatonic)\n\n<b>5. Music of the Spheres Gypsy Mezzo</b> (Eastern European Gypsy scale)\n\n<b>6. Music of the Spheres Gypsy Soprano</b> (ditto, but lower, and different mode on that scale)\n\n<b>Most appropriately, a strong emotional atmosphere that I pick up from this ensemble's sound is that of an unimaginably strong and persistent sense of <i>SURPRISE</i>, as though felt from some very deep source. That effect is primarily from the combination of the Gypsy chimes &#8212; which on their own sound deeply melancholic &#8212; with any of the pentatonic ones, and here is spiced up with the Olympos chimes, giving some dissonant touches reminiscent of some music of B&#233;la Bart&#243;k, and the Mars chimes giving a really odd suggestion of a major scale poking out at times in the top end. Sounds like fun? &#8212; Well, at least this errant monkey thinks so!</b>\n\nI recorded this on 15 April 2014, on the rough slope just below Hunting Gate, which latter marks the highest point of the Hunter's Path, high up on the north side of the Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK.\n\nThis was a particularly bold musical adventure of mine. To my ears this has come out as something incredibly beautiful, in a challenging and healthily invigorating way. We <em>need</em> our horizons and brain function opened up and broadened, even if we misguidedly view anything of the sort as anathema! This is all about (further) opening up our ability to experience life with abundance, variety and full vividness &#8212; in short, being fully human! \n\nThis took a lot of time to set up in order to get optimal balance between the different chimes and so to achieve a reasonable ensemble effect. The Gypsy chimes in particular always needed to be further away than the Woodstock ones because of their strong and penetrating tone. The Mars chimes really needed to have been a little further away because they were particularly shrill and penetrating, whereas the Mercury chimes (the smallest and highest-pitched) needed to be a little closer still. A perfect balance was really tricky to get anything near achieving, because of the limited number of suitably positioned hanging points on the various tree branches.\n\nFor more details about the different chimes used, please go to <b><a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-windchimes.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-windchimes.htm</a></b>.\n\n<img alt=\"This session's full ensemble\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/140415_ensemble_of_wind_chimes_hung_on_tree_branches_for_recording,_teign_gorge.jpg\">\n<i>The full ensemble for this session &#8212; from left to right: Olympos, Gypsy Mezzo, Mars, Polaris (difficult to see), Mercury, Gypsy Soprano. The Gypsy chimes are further away because of their strong and penetrating tone.</i>\n\n<b>Techie stuff</b>\n\nThe recorder was Sony PCM-M10, with R&#248;de DeadKitten furry windshield. It was placed on a Zipshot Mini tripod, which I regard as more 'midi' than 'mini'.\n\nPost-recording processing was to apply EQ in Audacity to correct for the muffling effect of the windshield &#8212; and then more recently stereo widening / sharpening-up using the VST plugin A1 Stereo Control (160% widening).\n\n<b>Please remember to give this recording a rating &#8212; Thank you!</b>&#160; <img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\">",

        "description": "A cold winter wind around midnight, outside the fence of the school's stadium, in a residential area of the city. Very cold weather (-22 \u00b0C). The wind blows across the expanses of the stadium, raising a snowdrift. The maple trees above me crackle from the frost and the onslaught of close gusts of wind. The city sleeps. As you can hear, there is practically no traffic noise, but there are quieter background man-made noises, one of them is the low-frequency background from the city boiler room, which is very clearly audible in winter.\nRecorded January 21, 2024 on Tascam DR-05x with post processing.\nLocation: Ekaterinburg (Russia).\nI ask you, if possible, to help this wonderful site (not me) stay afloat and develop further.

Woodstock Chimes of Olympos</b> (relatively low-pitched Ancient Greek scale)\n\n<b>2. Woodstock Chimes of Mars</b> (high-pitched; not sure what the scale is!)\n\n<b>Puzzlingly, a strong emotional atmosphere that I pick up from this duo's sound is that of a pervasive deep <i>melancholy or sadness</i> &#8212; though not as intense and profound as when pentatonic chimes are combined with the Olympos.</b>\n\nI recorded this on 1 April 2014, on the rough slope just below Hunting Gate, which latter marks the highest point of the Hunter's Path, high up on the north side of the Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK.\n\nFor more details about the different chimes used, please go to <b><a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-windchimes.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-windchimes.htm</a></b>.\n\n<img alt=\"Four Woodstock chimes in earlier session at same spot\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/140401-140319_recording_wind_chimes_%28several_sets%29_overlooking_teign_gorge_02.jpg\">\n<i>Recording four Woodstock chimes in an earlier session (19 March 2014).

I have no note nor memory as to whether I had the recorder for this session perched on a branch (as in the photo above), or a Zipshot Mini tripod and thus closer to the ground. \n\nPost-recording processing was to apply EQ in Audacity to correct for the muffling effect of the windshield &#8212; and then more recently stereo widening / sharpening-up using the VST plugin A1 Stereo Control (160% widening).\n\n<b>Please remember to give this recording a rating &#8212; Thank you!</b>&#160; <img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\">",

Woodstock Chimes of Olympos</b> (relatively low-pitched Ancient Greek scale)\n\n<b>2. Woodstock Chimes of Polaris</b> (high-pitched pentatonic)\n\n<b>3. Woodstock Chimes of Mercury</b> (very high-pitched pentatonic)\n\n<b>4. Music of the Spheres Gypsy Mezzo</b> (Eastern European Gypsy scale)\n\n<b>5. Music of the Spheres Gypsy Soprano</b> (ditto, but lower, and different mode on that scale)\n\n<b>Most appropriately, a strong emotional atmosphere that I pick up from this ensemble's sound is that of an unimaginably strong and persistent sense of <i>SURPRISE</i> and <i>WONDER</i>, as though felt from some very deep source. That effect is primarily from the combination of the Gypsy chimes &#8212; which on their own sound deeply melancholic &#8212; with any of the pentatonic ones, and here is spiced up with the Olympos chimes, giving some dissonant touches reminiscent of some music of B&#233;la Bart&#243;k. Sounds like fun? &#8212; Well, at least this errant monkey thinks so!</b>\n\nI recorded this on 15 April 2014, on the rough slope just below Hunting Gate, which latter marks the highest point of the Hunter's Path, high up on the north side of the Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK.\n\nThis was a particularly bold musical adventure of mine. To my ears this has come out as something incredibly beautiful, in a challenging and healthily invigorating way. We <em>need</em> our horizons and brain function opened up and broadened, even if we misguidedly view anything of the sort as anathema! This is all about (further) opening up our ability to experience life with abundance, variety and full vividness &#8212; in short, being fully human! \n\nThis took a lot of time to set up in order to get optimal balance between the different chimes and so to achieve a reasonable ensemble effect. The Gypsy chimes in particular always needed to be further away than the Woodstock ones because of their strong and penetrating tone. A perfect balance was really tricky to get anything near achieving, because of the limited number of suitably positioned hanging points on the various tree branches.\n\nFor more details about the different chimes used, please go to <b><a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-windchimes.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-windchimes.htm</a></b>.\n\n<img alt=\"This session's full ensemble\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/140415_ensemble_of_wind_chimes_hung_on_tree_branches_for_recording,_teign_gorge.jpg\">\n<i>The full ensemble for this session &#8212; from left to right: Olympos, Gypsy Mezzo, Mars, Polaris (difficult to see), Mercury, Gypsy Soprano. The Gypsy chimes are further away because of their strong and penetrating tone.</i>\n\n<b>Techie stuff</b>\n\nThe recorder was Sony PCM-M10, with R&#248;de DeadKitten furry windshield. It was placed on a Zipshot Mini tripod, which I regard as more 'midi' than 'mini'.\n\nPost-recording processing was to apply EQ in Audacity to correct for the muffling effect of the windshield &#8212; and then more recently stereo widening / sharpening-up using the VST plugin A1 Stereo Control (160% widening). The 'change speed' effect in Audacity was used to produce this half-speed version.\n\n<b>Please remember to give this recording a rating &#8212; Thank you!</b>&#160; <img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\">",

        "description": "On 30th January 2013 I took out with me a set of Woodstock Chimes of Pluto and two sets of Music of the Spheres Gypsy wind chimes - the Soprano and Mezzo sizes, the sounds of which latter two mesh together beautifully. I was aiming for the same recording location as I used for my previous wind chimes recordings - in November 2012.\n\nHowever, this time a very strong wind was blowing over the more exposed parts, and, on the Hunters' Path from Drewsteignton (Devon, UK), high up on the side of the so-called Teign Gorge above Fingle Bridge, as I was coming out of the woods that clothe the steep valley slopes I was suddenly blasted by a wind of about gale force (force 8 on the Beaufort scale), and realized that my previous recording locations here would most likely be too windy this time.\n\nSo, I withdrew very slightly back into the top of the woods, descending slightly to just below the top part of the narrow track that ascends steeply from Fingle Bridge to join the Hunters' Path, and found a suitable group of low tree branches that were sufficiently sheltered to be getting a very nice range of wind strength, from very little indeed up to 'fresh' (force 5 on the Beaufort scale).\n\nThus today was not only to be an experiment to see to what extent the Gypsy chimes could usefully be combined with any of the quite different sounding Woodstock chimes, but also an opportunity to record a gale in the woods, with wind chimes intermingled in the wind sound and indeed quite often buried in it as the most powerful gusts came. The results turned out to be interesting and very much in accordance with what I'd been hankering after for as long as I'd been thinking of recording wind chimes.\n\nIt's important, therefore, to enable yourself to perceive this particular day's recordings NOT as 'failed' or otherwise bad chimes recordings, but as extremely successful gale-in-the-woods recordings complete with wind chimes.\n\n<i>To tell the truth, this particular day's spectacular recording session very nearly didn't happen! I had arrived in the woods thinking just of recording the particular chimes I'd brought out, just with a little wind noise, and when I got setting up for the first recording, and the chimes were being drowned out by a monstrous gust in the trees, I had great doubts about continuing, but then rather dubiously set that recording going. After about 10 minutes I was wondering why the hell I was loitering around there for an obvious failure of a recording to run its course, and was starting to think of packing up there and then and trying to find a more sheltered place.</i>\n\n<i>At that point I used a special inner inquiry method that I call <a href=\"https://www.clarity-of-being.org/glossary.htm#Helpfulness_Testing\" rel=\"nofollow\">Helpfulness Testing</a>, and it gave a 'weakening' response (effectively a thumbs-down) to my doing so, so, a little perplexed, I let the recording run (originally intended to run for 40 to 45 minutes, to allow for some disturbances to be edited out). It was during the remainder of the time of that recording that I progressively woke up to what I was really recording, and started to get excited at the fact of my getting a real cracker of a gale recording - and then I stuck to that same spot for the following seven extended recordings, then really excited to record as much as I could there.\n\nAs well as the wind commotion, actually the River Teign far below was making its own quieter commotion, for it was particularly full after a lot of heavy rain, but during my whole 5+ hours' recording session I could never quite differentiate between the rushing sound of the Teign and the wind.\n\nOne thing you are bound to notice is that the degree of activity of the chimes does not tally all that much with the degree of roaring of the wind in the trees. This is because of my relatively sheltered position, so the big and powerful eddies in the flow of the air as it comes over the hill into the valley go careering through the tree branches above and around me, but the gusts that come to me and the recorder and chimes are almost all NOT those directly but smaller subsidiary eddies that come spinning off the big ones.\n\nIt's inevitable that the wind commotion will make particularly fatiguing listening, especially to the full-length recordings, when played through anything other than really good speakers / headphones. Please note that in the full-length recordings made on this day, ALL of them have some awesomely powerful and loud wind gusts that at times virtually drown out the chimes, so any of the excerpts here seeming louder or quieter than others is in fact misleading, as all the full length recordings have very loud and also almost quiet (albeit far from silent!) moments.\n\nPlease note also, that if you watch the waveform image here on Freesound while playing the excerpts you will NOT get the proper effect. The big wind gusts sound immensely more powerful and even frightening when you are NOT watching that, so you never know how much more the sound is going to increase, maybe to blow you and indeed the whole of Existence away! :-)\n\nAnother listening tip - if you have really good and wide stereo separation you will find that the wind sound is not simply a fluctuating roar (really rather boring!), but a wonderful drama of ogreish 'wind monsters' chasing around here, there, and who knows where! The three-dimensional movement really makes an exciting drama of it all.\n\nThis recording is of the Woodstock Chimes of Pluto, plus the Music of the Spheres Gypsy Chimes, Soprano and Mezzo sizes. The combination of the Pluto and Gypsy chimes produces a curious effect. The Pluto chimes neutralize the intense emotional feel of the Gypsy chimes, and at the same time the latter neutralize the Pluto Chimes' buoyant 'happy' feel, and the combination has a delicately wistful sound as heard on my quite reasonable computer speakers. However, on my hi-fi system comes a revelation, and the effect is not really wistful at all but an almost happy and rejoicing sound, centred in certain gentle and teasing harmonic astringencies that this chimes combination has brought us.\n\nThis is a 5-minute excerpt from the 36 minutes full recording.\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/recording-nr-top-of-woods-above-fingle-bridge.jpg\"></i>\n<i>This photo shows my recording studio for 30th January 2013 - almost at the top of the north side of the Teign Gorge, and facing obliquely over the valley, so that the great gusts of wind come roaring from the right and then go careering round over and down into the valley. The sets of chimes visible are the Gypsy Mezzo (left, and further away) and the Pluto (right).\nNote that the former being further away is not a bit of carelessness of mine, but a quite deliberate placement. I learnt from my first Gypsy Chimes recordings (back in November) that for best results those particular chimes need to be placed further from the microphones than the Woodstock or bamboo chimes (at least, those that I have), on account of their more penetrating and potentially overpowering tone.</i><br>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/track-high-above-fingle-bridge.jpg\">\n<i>Looking the other way from near the top of the track ascending from Fingle Bridge, which latter is hidden way down below. The recorder is about 25 metres behind me, just a little down the slope from this track.</i>\n\nRecording made with a Sony PCM-M10 on a Velbon mini-tripod, using the built-in microphones covered with a Rode Dead Kitten.\n\n<img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/arrow-long-right.gif\"> Please note that all recordings from 5th January to 2nd Feb 2013, inclusive (i.e. including this one) did not receive any correction for high-frequency attenuation caused by the new Rode Dead Kitten windshield. Subsequently I was able to work out a graphic EQ profile to apply to all recordings that used that windshield, and have applied it retrospectively - but I have no plans to go through the hassle of re-uploading here the recordings that originally missed out on that correction. Therefore, copies of recordings made in that period, including this one, which I supply on CDs or as licensed copies for commercial use, will have better sound quality and will sound clearer, more 'present', and with more precision of detail than what you hear from here.\n\n<b>Please note that only very good speakers / headphones with a very extended and flat frequency response will do this recording real justice, and, as already noted, lesser speakers / headphones would make this sound quite fatiguing to listen to.  Please also note that the volume level of this recording has been carefully adjusted for listening purposes, and ALL my recordings so far are meant to be listened to with a volume setting that would give a realistic level for playback of CLASSICAL music (a large but not exceptional symphony orchestra). If you have the right volume setting, you should not need to change that setting from one recording of mine to another.</b>\n<p><i>(Later note: This recording - with better sound than here - is one of my CD-quality downloads, and can be found in <a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">my e-Store</a>.)</i></p>\n<p><b>Please remember to give this recording a rating! <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\"></b></p>",

        "description": "Recording made on 14th November 2012 with a Sony PCM-M10 on a Hama mini-tripod, using the built-in microphones covered with a Rycote Mini Windjammer. I have used a graphic EQ profile in WavePad to compensate for the slight muffling of the sound caused by the Windjammer. I also applied a 3dB reduction to low bass frequencies, to render the wind noise in the microphones a bit less 'heavy'.\n\nOn 14th November 2012 I took out with me three sets of Woodstock wind chimes, with the intent to record about 20 minutes of each solo, and a full half-hour of each of the four possible combinations of these. Because of the likely interruptions through people passing by along the track, plus intrusions from aeroplanes, I aimed to record for longer than the target duration each time, to allow for cutting bits out - as indeed I had to quite a lot. I hung the chimes on small low branches of a particular well situated stunted tree by the Hunter's Path overlooking the over-steepened valley (popularly known as the Teign Gorge, though it is not actually a gorge) in the vicinity of Sharp Tor, very near Castle Drogo.  There is thus a constant quiet background of rushing water far below.\n\nThis recording is of the tenor-pitched Gregorian Chimes together with Chimes of Olympos and the smaller and thus higher-pitched Chimes of Pluto. The Gregorian chimes are tuned to a Gregorian chant scale, while the Chimes of Olympos are tuned to a melancholy sounding Ancient Greek pentatonic scale, and the Pluto chimes are tuned to a very sweet sounding pentatonic scale, and thus there is an intriguing interaction between the three sound worlds, which helps to keep one's attention rather than send one to sleep. \n\nTo my ears this particular combination of the chimes is surely one of the most intensely beautiful of all possible wind chimes sounds, and the full 35+ minutes recording, of which this is just a 5-minute excerpt, is truly hauntingly beautiful. It is as though the wind itself had 'understood' the chimes and played them in ways that have a strong emotional effect and seem to be telling a story (or indeed whole plethora of stories), as though this were a composed work of symphonic music.\n\nThe photo below is of the actual tree used for this recording, with the recorder on the mini-tripod just visible rather awkwardly astride the base of a branch. The photo actually shows the setup for the previous week's recording of the Pluto chimes, and the setup for this recording differs only in that I had the chimes on branches directly overlooking the valley slope (i.e. on the left in this view), and the recorder was in the same position except, unsurprisingly, pointing across the valley (i.e. again, to the left in this view).\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/chimes-pluto-hunters-path-299x355.jpg\">\n\nPlease note that the volume level of this recording has been carefully adjusted for listening purposes, and ALL my recordings so far are meant to be listened to with a volume setting that would give a realistic level for playback of CLASSICAL music (a large but not exceptional symphony orchestra). If you have the right volume setting, you should not need to change that setting from one recording of mine to another.\n<p><i>(Later note: This recording - with better sound than here - is one of my CD-quality downloads, and can be found in <a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">my e-Store</a>.)</i></p>\n<p><b>Please remember to give this recording a rating! <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\"></b></p>",

Some are stagnant or static and with few birds.\r\nThe presents of the colourful red and yellow dry leaves that is still on the trees, creates the noise of the wind with rustling whispers.\r\nIs a constantly form of natural white noise that is always changing and evolving. These recordings is from my third attempt.\r\nI think it is very difficult to record the \u201cspirit\u201d and unique sound of the wind. This is pure natural wind sounds (no layering, no post-processing, no synthesizers). Originally recorded at 24 bit Sony DAT TCD-D7 on a Sony ECM-909 microphone. Recorded in Sweden September of 2007 in a wet cold beautiful colourful forest, with all kind of trees, far away from any traffic or human sounds.",

        "description": "<b>A real 'Wow!' wind chimes ensemble hung up from trees high up in the Teign Gorge:</b>\n\n<b>1. Woodstock Chimes of Olympos</b> (relatively low-pitched Ancient Greek scale)\n\n<b>2. Woodstock Chimes of Polaris</b> (high-pitched pentatonic)\n\n<b>3. Woodstock Chimes of Mercury</b> (very high-pitched pentatonic)\n\n<b>4. Music of the Spheres Gypsy Mezzo</b> (Eastern European Gypsy scale)\n\n<b>5. Music of the Spheres Gypsy Soprano</b> (ditto, but lower, and different mode on that scale)\n\n<b>Most appropriately, a strong emotional atmosphere that I pick up from this ensemble's sound is that of an unimaginably strong and persistent sense of <i>SURPRISE</i>, as though felt from some very deep source. That effect is primarily from the combination of the Gypsy chimes &#8212; which on their own sound deeply melancholic &#8212; with any of the pentatonic ones, and here is spiced up with the Olympos chimes, giving some dissonant touches reminiscent of some music of B&#233;la Bart&#243;k. Sounds like fun? &#8212; Well, at least this errant monkey thinks so!</b>\n\nI recorded this on 15 April 2014, on the rough slope just below Hunting Gate, which latter marks the highest point of the Hunter's Path, high up on the north side of the Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK.\n\nThis was a particularly bold musical adventure of mine. To my ears this has come out as something incredibly beautiful, in a challenging and healthily invigorating way. We <em>need</em> our horizons and brain function opened up and broadened, even if we misguidedly view anything of the sort as anathema! This is all about (further) opening up our ability to experience life with abundance, variety and full vividness &#8212; in short, being fully human! \n\nThis took a lot of time to set up in order to get optimal balance between the different chimes and so to achieve a reasonable ensemble effect. The Gypsy chimes in particular always needed to be further away than the Woodstock ones because of their strong and penetrating tone. A perfect balance was really tricky to get anything near achieving, because of the limited number of suitably positioned hanging points on the various tree branches.\n\nFor more details about the different chimes used, please go to <b><a href=\"https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-windchimes.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.philipgoddard.com/shop/store-windchimes.htm</a></b>.\n\n<img alt=\"This session's full ensemble\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/140415_ensemble_of_wind_chimes_hung_on_tree_branches_for_recording,_teign_gorge.jpg\">\n<i>The full ensemble for this session &#8212; from left to right: Olympos, Gypsy Mezzo, Mars, Polaris (difficult to see), Mercury, Gypsy Soprano. The Gypsy chimes are further away because of their strong and penetrating tone.</i>\n\n<b>Techie stuff</b>\n\nThe recorder was Sony PCM-M10, with R&#248;de DeadKitten furry windshield. It was placed on a Zipshot Mini tripod, which I regard as more 'midi' than 'mini'.\n\nPost-recording processing was to apply EQ in Audacity to correct for the muffling effect of the windshield &#8212; and then more recently stereo widening / sharpening-up using the VST plugin A1 Stereo Control (160% widening).\n\n<b>Please remember to give this recording a rating &#8212; Thank you!</b>&#160; <img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\">",

Original Recording Equipment: MixPre 3 version 2 and two Sennheiser MKH 8020s set 2 feet apart. \n\nThe winter winds leaving the front yard create a symphony of soothing sounds that evoke a sense of tranquility and peace. As the brisk breeze rustles through the bare branches of trees, it produces a gentle whispering sound that is both calming and melodic. The crisp air carries with it the faint scent of pine and snow, adding to the serene atmosphere. Occasionally, there is a soft crunching noise as frost-covered leaves are swept along by the wind, creating a gentle rhythm that lulls one into a state of relaxation. The distant howling of coyotes adds an eerie yet mesmerizing element to the overall auditory experience. Overall, the soundscape created by winter winds leaving the front yard provides a welcome respite from the hustle and bustle of everyday life, allowing one to momentarily escape into nature's embrace.",

        "description": "<b>Nature-Symphony 11 (The Eternal Astronomer's gaze) \u2014 The original field recording (<a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/Philip_Goddard/sounds/699999/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://freesound.org/people/Philip_Goddard/sounds/699999/</a> ) had a lovely early spring fine breezy day quality about it, but this two-layer transformation of it is dramatically different!</b>\n\n<b>This is a real tough, challenging work, which would be riveting for those who are able to open to it, but undoubtedly repellent to the vast majority, who lack the requisite awareness and mental flexibility to cope with its ever-shifting harmonic clusters and the obsessive tone that shines out from the Galaxy, through all its dust clouds and other obscuring phenomena. It's a great wrench after the sweet and relatively unchallenging sound of Nature-Symphony 10 \u2014 but then for me the latter was my 'lightest' and least challenging Nature-Symphony so far, and for me perhaps the least satisfying \u2014 shall we say, 'just a little <i>divertimento</i>'. This one is on the other pole, as is my next upload here, <i>Nature-Symphony 12 (Around the rim of the quivering volcano)</i>. They are both intense visionary pieces, as suggested by their titles.</b>\n\nI myself was dumbfounded, when I idly put two differently speed-reduced copies of the original field recording into Audacity as layers, gave them the usual Nature-Symphony processing, and idly started playback before making expected adjustments; I was then riveted and had to listen to the end of the shorter (top) layer, where I just had to do a few minutes' work to get the piece to finish in a meaningful way. No further adjustments required. Mix-and-render and save \u2014 simple!\n\n<b>Chimes used:</b>\n\n<b>1. Music of the Spheres Gypsy Chimes, Mezzo and Soprano</b> (both tuned to different modes on an Eastern European Gypsy scale)\n\n<b>2. Bamboo chimes, large and small set</b> (rather indeterminate tuning, with a touch of whole-tone scale &#8212; bought cheaply at local store)\n\nI made the original field recording on 5 March 2013 beside the the Hunter's Path, high up on north side of the Teign Gorge, Drewsteignton, Devon, UK.\n\n<b>Advisory</b>\n\nThis work is meant to sound rather distant, so I strongly recommend NOT turning the volume control higher than a sensible normal listening level. For extended sections a penetrating relatively high G is persistently sounding from the Gypsy Mezzo chime in the top layer, and this can be wearying and indeed somewhat harmful if you listen to this (especially repeatedly) at more than the intended level.\n\n<img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/130305_recording_wind_chimes_by_hunter's_path,_teign_gorge.jpg\" alt=\"The original recording taking place\">\n<i>The original recording taking place. The two bamboo chimes are on the left, and the two Gypsy chimes are on the right.</i>\n\n<b>Techie stuff:</b>\n\nThe recorder was Sony PCM-M10, with R\u00f8de DeadKitten furry windshield (original, more effective version). It was set up on a Velbon Mini tripod. Although I fairly quickly learned subsequently to avoid having recorders so close to the ground (distorts the frequency spectrum and tends to overemphasize lower parts of the frequency range), actually in this situation it was necessary to have the recorder really low down, where the wind was much lighter.\n\nPost-recording processing was to apply EQ in Audacity to correct for the muffling effect of the windshield &#8212; and then more recently stereo widening / sharpening-up using the VST plugin A1 Stereo Control (160% widening).\n\nTo create this Nature-Symphony from it, I took two copies and used the 'change speed and pitch' effect in WavePad to reduce the speed to achieve the intended pitch reduction \u2014 top layer an octave lower, and bottom layer a minor seventh below that. Further processing then in Audacity: I used the OrilRiver VST plugin to apply a moderately back-of-cathedral acoustic. I allowed both layers to start at the same time, so they immediately start becoming more and more out of step with each other.\n\nBecause the last 45 minutes of the bottom layer were not only left unused but contained its most thrilling activity, I saved that, with a strong inner nudging to add that to another processed field recording \u2014 and that quickly led to my creating Nature-Symphony 12 (next upload here).\n\n<b>Please remember to give this recording a rating &#8212; Thank you!</b>&#160; <img src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\">",
