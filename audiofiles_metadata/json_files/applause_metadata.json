        "description": "Subject : A crowd applauding. Was for a staged TV show with bands playing then being interviewed.\nDate YMD : 2024 12 19\nLocation : Up 10m or so in the engineer booth. France\nHardware : Zoom H5 XY capsule.\nWeather : Night time, there was heavy wind outside which may appear in some recordings of that day.\nNotes : There were about 120 people.\nProcessing : Trimmed and Normalized in Audacity. Looping 4 synced applauses, de-ordering them and overlaying another applause in the background to hide the stitches and make it feel less looped.\nTips :\n\nAttribution is greatly appreciated but not required. Recommendation : X sound by Sadiquecat on <a href=\"http://Freesound.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Freesound.org</a> in CC0 licence.\n\nHope you enjoy :)\nPS: Id love to hear how you use this sound, feel free to link your creations or share how/why you listen to this :)",

Was for a staged TV show with bands playing then being interviewed.\nDate YMD : 2024 12 19\nLocation : Up 10m or so in the engineer booth. France\nHardware : Zoom H5 XY capsule.\nWeather : Night time, there was heavy wind outside which may appear in some recordings of that day.\nNotes : There were about 120 people.\nProcessing : Trimmed and Normalized in Audacity. Looping 4 synced applauses, de-ordering them and overlaying another applause in the background to hide the stitches and make it feel less looped.\nTips : I have not yet taken the time to export individual applause/cheer and name them/upload them. You're welcome re-upload individual takes but please link the original sound (this) if you do so.\n\nAttribution is greatly appreciated but not required. Recommendation : X sound by Sadiquecat on <a href=\"http://Freesound.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Freesound.org</a> in CC0 licence.\n\nHope you enjoy :)\nPS: Id love to hear how you use this sound, feel free to link your creations or share how/why you listen to this :)",

        "description": "These are canned crowd sounds, recorded for a theatrical production.  These were recorded in quad, with the design to be played out of four speakers, one near each corner of the room.  We made them with a small group of people, and recorded 20 layers or so of each reaction, moving the group around the room.  There are some alternative arrangements of the layers, scooted around in time, to make some variation, which would help realism, if the sounds needed to be played back to back, like 3 rounds of applause in a row.  These are the \u201cstaggered\u201d files.\n\nThese were recorded in a medium size hall, with AKG C414\u2019s for the front left and right channels, and Neumann KM184\u2019s for the rear left and right channels.",

        "description": "Another long round of applause from a recording of the Saskatoon Childrens' Choir.  This applause is particularly nice because not only does it have a nice \"ebb and flow\" to it as different participants take the stage but also it has a clearly defined beginning.  Unfortunately it had to be faded out because someone started messing about on the piano.  Recorded by David Puls at 3rd Avenue United Church on Friday 16th of April 2010.  Source was captured with various microphones on the choir and round the venue through Millennia Media and Neve preamps into an Alesis hard disc recorder.  Editing was done in Pro Tools and final normalization and fade was carried out in Cool Edit Pro.",

We made them with a small group of people, and recorded 20 layers or so of each reaction, moving the group around the room.  There are some alternative arrangements of the layers, scooted around in time, to make some variation, which would help realism, if the sounds needed to be played back to back, like 3 rounds of applause in a row.  These are the \u201cstaggered\u201d files.\n\nThese were recorded in a medium size hall, with AKG C414\u2019s for the front left and right channels, and Neumann KM184\u2019s for the rear left and right channels.",

These were recorded in quad, with the design to be played out of four speakers, one near each corner of the room.  We made them with a small group of people, and recorded 20 layers or so of each reaction, moving the group around the room.  There are some alternative arrangements of the layers, scooted around in time, to make some variation, which would help realism, if the sounds needed to be played back to back, like 3 rounds of applause in a row.  These are the \u201cstaggered\u201d files.\n\nThese were recorded in a medium size hall, with AKG C414\u2019s for the front left and right channels, and Neumann KM184\u2019s for the rear left and right channels.",

Unfortunately, I arrived too late to catch the beginning of the applause, but hey, better than nothing :)\nI was standing on a concrete block a little bit above the audience but still pretty close, maybe 6 meters away from the nearest person.\nThe concert took place at the Kulturforum, a large open concrete space next to the Berlin Philharmonic Hall.\nIt's a warm summer evening. After the applause, everybody starts leaving the place, maybe about 1000-1500 people.\nThe crowd is generally in a happy and talkative mood. There are lots of international folks and tourists, so you'll not only hear German, but also English and lots of other languages.\n\nRecorded with a Zoom H6 (XY mics).\n\nIn the same pack there is also a second recording made a bit later with more people passing by and talking.

        "description": "Marching band playing music outdoor. (3rd file) \nI made this recording in Nanterre (west suburb of Paris, France), during a local event about gardening and farm animals taking place downtown every year during the last weekend of November. \nOne can hear the municipal brass band playing music in the pedestrian street, voices from people watching and rambling around, and applause at the end of the performance. \nGreat thanks to La Fanfare de Nanterre for this nice performance ! \nRecorded in November 2024 with a Zoom H6essential (built-in XY microphones). \nFade in/out applied in Audacity.",
