Also good for when I work from home and I'm trying to drown out the TV and other distractions. The crowd noise is excellent at diffusing regular office conversation and the little funky back beat keeps the crowd noise from getting boring. This works really well even at fairly low volume i.e. you dont have to crank it loud to drown out the distractions.Hope you like it and thanks to everyone for the great sounds on this site.Combination of the following two files - Yet Another Bar Crowd - June 2007.wav (lonemonk)hip hop.wav(LS)PS - I purposely let the crowd noise run out for a few seconds at the end so that you can appreciate the full groove of the hip hop.wav. Has a nice effect when you loop the whole thing, gives you a little break from the crowd noise. Almost like you're stepping out of the room for a second.",

In the background, some noises from restaurants and shops along the street, and from time to time, a bicycle passes by. At #0:58, one can hear the voice of a man driving a horse carriage in my back, which will overpass on my left slightly after #1:35. Then, at #2:30, one can hear the beep of a taxi passing by slowly in the crowded area. \nAt #4:17, I\u2019m approaching the Ponte Vecchio (with many jewel shops on its side), which I\u2019ll cross during about two minutes and a half. At #6:50, I\u2019ll pass near a group of happy people celebrating a bridal shower. And finally, I\u2019ll go out from the pedestrian area and meet traffic. \nRecorded in April 2024 with an Olympus LS-P4 and Ohrwurm 3D binaural microphones. \nFade in/out and high pass filter at 60Hz -6dB/oct applied in Audacity. \n(If you want to use this sound as a mono audio file, you may have to delete one channel to avoid phase issues).",

This was recorded during the time the wedding party was taking pictures before the ceremony. The microphone was located in the balcony. The church normally holds a couple hundred people; there were about 20-30 people in the room at the time. You hear people chattering and laughing as well as general room noise. I edited out some of the more annoying sounds that called attention to themselves like obvious coughing, doors slamming, and camera shutters clicking. I also added a little reverb to give it more presence and to muddy up the voices a little bit. There are very few discernable words in this sample. The idea was to produce a solid drone of noise that can be used as background atmosphere.",

I am changing the angle a bit (turning arround myself). About the crowd, there is mostly Thai people talking but also many tourists, coming from a lot of different countries. Europe, China, USA, etc. \r\nWhen I recorded it, I enabled the low-cut function to avoid problems (I'm using cheaps dead cats). Bass frequencies are starting only from 80hz. There is nothing below;) \r\nRecorded with rodes nt5 stereo pair, into Fostex FR2 LE recorder 48khz 24bits depth. Geotagged",

(binaural, please use headset for 3D effect). \nThis binaural audio file is one of the recordings I made in Manila a few days before Christmas 2018, while I was rambling in the shops and in the crowded streets of Divisoria and Baklaran, which are two places where you can find many sellers and vendors who sell everything you\u2019d like to buy... \nHere, the record starts while I\u2019m walking in a small street, then I go into a shop with a noisy electric fan near the entrance. \nRecorded in December 2018 with an Olympus LS-3 and Soundman OKM I binaural microphones (version 2018). \nFade in/out and high pass filter at 80Hz -6dB/oct applied in Audacity.",

The Eiffel Tower is at about 1 mile away right in front of me, on the left bank of the river. It\u2019s lights are shining, then the fireworks start (on the tower and on the right side of the river too), and here is what you can hear : \nAll around, thousands of people are watching and reacting, as fireworks and explosions are impressive. On the left, a photographer takes pictures. In the background, walla from the crowd, engines and some horns from vehicles moving slowly on the bridge in my back, some music from the surroundings (restaurants, boats, and phone), police siren at times... \nAt about 18\u201900\u2019\u2019, the final fireworks will start, and at about 19\u201930\u2019\u2019, the crowd become really enthusiastic ! \nRecorded in July 2023 with an Olympus LS-P4 and Ohrwurm 3D binaural microphones. \nFade in/out and high pass filter at 60Hz -6dB/oct applied in Audacity. \n(If you want to use this sound as a mono audio file, you may have to delete one channel to avoid phase issues).",

Rainy, drippy, thunder, crowded, restaurant sounds.    \r\n\r\nTechnical Specifications: Recorded with a Zoom H6 recorder using the attached stereo XY microphones. The sound was post-processed to make it more crisp and impactful (basic EQ, dB adjustment and trimming on Reaper DAW).

There were also many types of stalls, including those selling specialties and crafts, snacks, and playing games (especially shooting balloons), and there were also many people, not only during winter vacation and weekends, but also during the Comic-Con at that time. Although the weather was a bit cold, it did not reducing people's enthusiasm.

But crucially, no music is playing. This means you can either use this clean, or layer in your own rights-cleared music if you're using this in a film or whatever.\n\nRecorded in January 2019 with an iPhone X \u2014 don't let the recording device scare you, it sounds pretty good and certainly fine for this kind of background noise. Use it in any way you like for any purpose.\n\nUPDATE: I just uncovered a similar recording I made in 2016 at a different diner, and uploaded that here: <a href=\"https://freesound.org/people/edlundart/sounds/515719/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://freesound.org/people/edlundart/sounds/515719/</a> Pick whichever one you prefer, or use a combination of both!\n\nWarmly,\nBard Edlund, <a href=\"http://edlundart.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">edlundart.com</a>",

        "description": "One of the fanciest and most snobby Belgrade night lounges in Belgrade. I want YOU to use and abuse this sound as much as possible. This atmosphere was recorded from the street so maybe there is some of the traffic noise left in the background. But, when you think about it, who gives a damn! Enjoy and USE! Recorded with Zoom H4n. Please rate, comment and share. In case you download some of my sounds and use them in your audiovisual artwork, the only thing I ask from you is to let me know where and how they ended up. It would be a pleasure. Please feel free to send me a private message if you have any questions or suggestions. I really try to keep an open mind for everything. Thank you. Peace. Matt  ",

        "description": "While working on another audiobook, I decided to make this sound.\r\nIt's 38 voices, each saying different things, panned around and mixed together, creating a \"wall of sound\" that speaks like 38 radio channels at once.\r\n\r\nRecorded with a Zoom H2 via USB into Ardour2. Mixed and exported to FLAC with Ardour2.\r\n\r\nPS: It's all Polish (with some possible German shout-outs), but the amount of noise makes it almost completely incomprehensible. Only a few words that are being yelled in a different voice can be understood. No sound repeats here, no recycling - every voice and every second of this recording is unique. Yes, it required quite a lot of work to record so much talking in quality! It's almost an entire audiobook squeezed into 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nStrangely (or not) listening to this makes my mind rest, because the noise blocks all other sounds from the environment - making my mind free of stimulation, allowing for sleep-like rest state.\r\n\r\nThe signal is so much modulated that it appears to be not modulated at all - like static you get from a FM radio of you tune it wrong. The brain receives less data when you listen to this, than when you sit in a room hearing even faint (but distinct) noises from outside, other rooms, other people or yourself.\r\nThis is sound masking in action. A very interesting psychoacoustic property of human hearing.\r\n\r\nAlso: this is an interesting material to study of my voice's spectral energy distribution while speaking (as opposed to singing). As you can see using the spectrogram view, most energy is present in the band below 600 Hz.",

I experimented with the audio sounding by placing my phone on the floor beside where I was seated, so I hope this sound is usable.",

Loud amplified music, sound effects and flashing lights everywhere... All the ingredients for a great modern funfair! \nRecorded in July 2022 with an Olympus LS-P4 (internal microphones, TRESMIC system on). \nFade in/out and high pass filter at 140Hz -6dB/oct applied in audacity.",

For this second recording, there was a small coffee-shop just on my left, so you can also hear some customers talking, and the noisy coffee grinder/maker from 2\u201908\u2019\u2019 to 2\u201943\u2019\u2019. \nRecorded in May 2022 with an Olympus LS-P4 and Ohrwurm 3D binaural microphones. \nFade in/out and high pass filter at 60Hz -6dB/oct applied in Audacity.",

        "description": "Lively summer evening at Le Barcar\u00e8s, France. \nI made this 1 hour recording from the balcony of a flat located at the 3rd floor of a building, in the tourist spot of Le Barcar\u00e8s (south-west of France), during a warm summer evening. \nAt the beginning, one can hear lots of swifts flying and screaming in the clear skies, while tourists are walking, talking, and eating in the restaurants of this pedestrian street. Then, slowly, the swifts will become calm and sleep, while people will continue eating and chatting. From time to time, some dogs will bark and some vehicles will pass by. And finally, the atmosphere will become quieter, and tourists will go home. \nRecorded in July 2022 with an Olympus LS-P4 and Micbooster Clippy Stereo EM272 microphones (Primo em272), in AB position (about 40cm). \nFade in/out and high pass filter at 60Hz -6dB/oct applied in Audacity. \n(If you want to use this sound as a mono audio file, you may have to delete one channel to avoid phase issues).",

(Binaural, please use headset for 3D effects)\nI made this recording while walking in down town market of Nanterre, in the suburbs of Paris, France. \nThe market is held every Saturday morning. Many sellers and buyers are French, but some of them are from North Africa (especially Morocco and Algeria), and they\u2019re talking Arab language too. \nSo, at the beginning of the recording, I start to walk from the street. Here, you can buy displays, , clothes, shoes, toys, bed sheets, kitchen tools, and many more ! It\u2019s still quite calm. \nThen, at around 1\u201930\u2019\u2019, I\u2019m coming in the semi-indoor market, where you can find vegetables, fruits, meat, fish, cheese, and many customers ! \nAt about 3\u201930\u2019\u2019, I will exit, and go in the other side of the market, where you can find many things like shoes, clothes and kitchen tools again. \nFinally, I\u2019m going back using another way, crossing again the busy semi-indoor market from 5\u201920\u2019\u2019 to 7\u201915\u2019\u2019, before coming back to my starting point. \nHope you\u2019ll enjoy the tour ! \nRecorded in September 2021 with an Olympus LS-P4 and Ohrwurm 3D binaural microphones. \nFade in/out and high pass filter at 60Hz -6dB/oct applied in Audacity.",

        "description": "The sound was recorded at the university campus market. This is the 17th Youth Entrepreneurship Street Activity in Guilin University Of Electronic Technology, where many students were setting up stalls to do their own business. Some sell groceries, some do wholesale, some do game stall (such as shooting balloons), some sell anime or handmade craftwork, which are very mixed, basically mixing supermarkets, comic market, and amusement parks together. People are also using various methods to attract customers, such as singing, shouting or other advertisement. And besides students, there are also some parents and children among the customers. Of course, I also participated in it.\nThe recording time is in 8:15 to 8:45(pm) on May 20, 2024. It's more commemorative than practical for the sound . Recording by Zoom H1N.\nAttachment: Some photos for display environment (some people have requested some blurring treatment)\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/200241208@N05/53742484701/in/dateposted-public/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53742484701_a2b63d1f35_c.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_20240520_204226\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/200241208@N05/53742484516/in/dateposted-public/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53742484516_4495ea0b21_c.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_20240521_190946\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/200241208@N05/53742484176/in/dateposted-public/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53742484176_f19be68403_c.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_20240521_191016\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/200241208@N05/53742811414/in/dateposted-public/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53742811414_5f76581471_c.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_20240521_192414\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/200241208@N05/53742898665/in/dateposted-public/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53742898665_7e06d9f040_c.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_20240521_192133\"></a>",

Although not long, this sound provides a detailed record of the soundscape of this snack street, including the sound of peddling, advertising music, the sound of iron making, and the noisy voices of passersby and so on.

(Warning : wide dynamic range audio file !)\nIn the city of Rueil-Malmaison (near Paris, France), every 3 or 4 years, Emperor Napoleon, who was an important people in French History, is celebrated. During two days, people wear period costumes, and like to recall heroic battles of these times. \nHere, One can hear some of them demonstrating how they use an authentic old cannon in the park of Ch\u00e2teau de Malmaison (Malmaison Castle). So, eight cannon shots can be heard in total : at 0\u201900\u2019\u2019, 0\u201934\u2019\u2019, 0\u201945\u2019\u2019, 0\u201951\u2019\u2019, 1\u201901\u2019\u2019, 1\u201953\u2019\u2019, 2\u201911\u2019\u2019 and 2\u201923\u2019\u2019 . Well, looks like they\u2019re happy to play with their big toy ! ;-) In the background, voices of people watching and walking in the surroundings. \nPlease note that the dynamic range of this file is quite wide, so you\u2019ll probably have to compress the audio if you\u2019d like to use it in your project. \nRecorded in September 2022 with an Olympus LS-100 (internal microphones). \nFade in/out applied in Audacity.",

The recording was made at the corner of the pedestrian Xavier Privas and Huchette streets, with the mics aimed diagonally across the street, about 4.5 feet above ground. By a happy coincidence (I'd like to say that I engineered it, but I didn't), this sound file loops seamlessly.\r\n\r\nThe clip includes the sounds of many people passing by (the area was very crowded), and some snippets of conversation, mostly in French, with a few other languages thrown in. Some faint traffic noise can be heard on the left, from the busy Quai Saint Michel street along the south bank of the Seine River, at the north end of the Xavier Privas street (left of the mics in this recording).\r\n\r\nRecorded with a hand-held Zoom H4n, stereo, 96 kHz / 24 bits, built-in mics",

They almost cannot walk among the people, but they laugh, sing and bring a hat to see if people put some coins. Recorded with a Sony PCM-D50 and microphones built.
