        "description": "This 48KHz/24bit sample pack contains 49 samples of close-mic'd female laughter.  A well-known author visited the studio to record the 'audio book' version of her novel for her publisher.  During the 16 hours (!) it took to record the 90,000 word story we got on really well and our jolly banter made it onto the unedited tracks.  The author has given me permission to keep and share her laughter as long as I don't release her identity.  Recorded with the incredible Josephson C720 microphone through NPNG preamp and Empirical Labs compression.  Tracked to Pro Tools with final edits performed in Cool Edit Pro.  At some points my voice may be heard through the talkback and there are some movement noises and paper shuffling etc.  There is also the occasional spoken word.  I'm not sure why some of these samples are clipped to snot; probably a Pro Tools gremlin.  Still, it doesn't sound too bad.",

Lowered the pitch, accelerated the speed (+2%) and added a light echo to the first track. Heightened the pitch (+65%) and accelerated the tempo (+2%) of the second track. Lowered the pitch (-65%) and changed the tempo (-5%) of the third track. Misaligned all three tracks with eachother in order to create a \u201cnatural\u201d-sounding lag between them. Added reverb to the entire sound. \r\n\r\n\r\nDescription: The evil laughter of goblins and vampires (4 seconds).\r\n\r\nDescriptif selon la typologie de Schaeffer : Il s'agit d'un son complexe \u00e0 l\u2019attaque abrupte, lequel comporte un staccato et une variation serpentine.\r\nCode correspondant : X\u2019\u2019",

A well-known author visited the studio to record the 'audio book' version of her novel for her publisher.  During the 16 hours (!) it took to record the 90,000 word story we got on really well and our jolly banter made it onto the unedited tracks.  The author has given me permission to keep and share her laughter as long as I don't release her identity.  Recorded with the incredible Josephson C720 microphone through NPNG preamp and Empirical Labs compression.  Tracked to Pro Tools with final edits performed in Cool Edit Pro.  At some points my voice may be heard through the talkback and there are some movement noises and paper shuffling etc.  There is also the occasional spoken word.  I'm not sure why some of these samples are clipped to snot; probably a Pro Tools gremlin.  Still, it doesn't sound too bad.",

A well-known author visited the studio to record the 'audio book' version of her novel for her publisher.  During the 16 hours (!) it took to record the 90,000 word story we got on really well and our jolly banter made it onto the unedited tracks.  The author has given me permission to keep and share her laughter as long as I don't release her identity.  Recorded with the incredible Josephson C720 microphone through NPNG preamp and Empirical Labs compression.  Tracked to Pro Tools with final edits performed in Cool Edit Pro.  At some points my voice may be heard through the talkback and there are some movement noises and paper shuffling etc.  There is also the occasional spoken word.  I'm not sure why some of these samples are clipped to snot; probably a Pro Tools gremlin.  Still, it doesn't sound too bad.",

A well-known author visited the studio to record the 'audio book' version of her novel for her publisher.  During the 16 hours (!) it took to record the 90,000 word story we got on really well and our jolly banter made it onto the unedited tracks.  The author has given me permission to keep and share her laughter as long as I don't release her identity.  Recorded with the incredible Josephson C720 microphone through NPNG preamp and Empirical Labs compression.  Tracked to Pro Tools with final edits performed in Cool Edit Pro.  At some points my voice may be heard through the talkback and there are some movement noises and paper shuffling etc.  There is also the occasional spoken word.  I'm not sure why some of these samples are clipped to snot; probably a Pro Tools gremlin.  Still, it doesn't sound too bad.",

A well-known author visited the studio to record the 'audio book' version of her novel for her publisher.  During the 16 hours (!) it took to record the 90,000 word story we got on really well and our jolly banter made it onto the unedited tracks.  The author has given me permission to keep and share her laughter as long as I don't release her identity.  Recorded with the incredible Josephson C720 microphone through NPNG preamp and Empirical Labs compression.  Tracked to Pro Tools with final edits performed in Cool Edit Pro.  At some points my voice may be heard through the talkback and there are some movement noises and paper shuffling etc.  There is also the occasional spoken word.  I'm not sure why some of these samples are clipped to snot; probably a Pro Tools gremlin.  Still, it doesn't sound too bad.",

        "description": "This 48KHz/24bit sample pack contains 49 samples of close-mic'd female laughter.  A well-known author visited the studio to record the 'audio book' version of her novel for her publisher.  During the 16 hours (!) it took to record the 90,000 word story we got on really well and our jolly banter made it onto the unedited tracks.  The author has given me permission to keep and share her laughter as long as I don't release her identity.  Recorded with the incredible Josephson C720 microphone through NPNG preamp and Empirical Labs compression.  Tracked to Pro Tools with final edits performed in Cool Edit Pro.  At some points my voice may be heard through the talkback and there are some movement noises and paper shuffling etc.  There is also the occasional spoken word.  I'm not sure why some of these samples are clipped to snot; probably a Pro Tools gremlin.  Still, it doesn't sound too bad.",

A well-known author visited the studio to record the 'audio book' version of her novel for her publisher.  During the 16 hours (!) it took to record the 90,000 word story we got on really well and our jolly banter made it onto the unedited tracks.  The author has given me permission to keep and share her laughter as long as I don't release her identity.  Recorded with the incredible Josephson C720 microphone through NPNG preamp and Empirical Labs compression.  Tracked to Pro Tools with final edits performed in Cool Edit Pro.  At some points my voice may be heard through the talkback and there are some movement noises and paper shuffling etc.  There is also the occasional spoken word.  I'm not sure why some of these samples are clipped to snot; probably a Pro Tools gremlin.  Still, it doesn't sound too bad.",

        "description": "Sonic Object Draft: The Perfect Alarm Clock\r\nJames Shiel\r\n\r\nI used my extra alarm clock as my Sonic Object for this project. It served no needs in my room and I felt an object that already blasts noise could be repurposed for my needs.  My goal with the alarm clock is to take the simple audio device to its next level.  Alarm clocks blast beeping or music to wake up their owners, but why not take their output a bit further? Perhaps I could change it to still act as an alarm clock, but one that uses more extreme tactics to wake up its owner, while still relying entirely on audio to do so.  Perhaps rather than just annoying noises, my alarm clock will play even more motivating noises, like nails on a chalkboard, snoring, strange laughing, uncomfortable bodily noises, or even blatantly terrible or out of key music.  Behind all this I could add an incredibly high-pitched buzz that persists until the owner turns it off. Many of these sounds translated quite well in my piece.  Uncomfortable laughter, irritable buzzing, off key combinations of notes and all around chaos created the \u201cget out of bed now\u201d effect I was aiming for.  I was disappointed that my idea for \u201cpsychological triggers\u201d or speech at all in my piece didn\u2019t work with the rest of my sound.  I recorded a number of voices and had a character in mind that my clock might affect, but the speech did more to harm my piece\u2019s impact than to help it, and I decided to leave them out. \r\nI put a good amount of work into the appearance of the clock as well.  Broken buttons and traces of blood on the top makes it really appear as if it\u2019s being smashed in frustration every morning, and makes it seem all the more vial of a noise machine.\r\nIf I were to re do this assignment, I would think more about pacing, as my classmates agreed its climax was weaker than it could have been.  Overall though, I was happy with my piece. It\u2019s irritable and unwelcomed, even to the point I found myself sweating as I worked on it.  As a complete package it definitely looks and sounds as I had hoped: like an alarm clock from hell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "description": "A warm autumn day in an urban residential area. Children run and play around a tall residential complex, the building of which gives very noticeable reflections of sounds. People pass by (sometimes very close) and cars pull into the parking lot. There are conversations, laughter, and children's screams. The noise of urban traffic can be heard in the background.\nRecorded September 09, 2024 on Tascam DR-05x with post processing.\nLocation: Russia, Ekaterinburg.\nI ask you, if possible, to help this wonderful site (not me) stay afloat and develop further.

There are some alternative arrangements of the layers, scooted around in time, to make some variation, which would help realism, if the sounds needed to be played back to back, like 3 rounds of applause in a row.  These are the \u201cstaggered\u201d files.\n\nThese were recorded in a medium size hall, with AKG C414\u2019s for the front left and right channels, and Neumann KM184\u2019s for the rear left and right channels.",

They were hilarious, and I had this feeling something funny is going to happen. And it did. Try looping this sample. In my case, after five minutes of listening to this sample only, I started laughing so hard I fell off my chair XD. Recorded with Zoom H4n. Please rate, comment and share. In case you download some of my sounds and use them in your audiovisual artwork, the only thing I ask from you is to let me know where and how they ended up. It would be a pleasure. Please feel free to send me a private message if you have any questions or suggestions. I really try to keep an open mind for everything. Thank you. Peace. Matt ",

These were recorded in quad, with the design to be played out of four speakers, one near each corner of the room.  We made them with a small group of people, and recorded 20 layers or so of each reaction, moving the group around the room.  There are some alternative arrangements of the layers, scooted around in time, to make some variation, which would help realism, if the sounds needed to be played back to back, like 3 rounds of applause in a row.  These are the \u201cstaggered\u201d files.\n\nThese were recorded in a medium size hall, with AKG C414\u2019s for the front left and right channels, and Neumann KM184\u2019s for the rear left and right channels.",

The auditorium was intimate and acoustically excellent.\r\n\r\nIn the first section if applause you will here a mild rumble.  There was a standing ovation, and that's what that rumble is.\r\n\r\nI also included some quiet bits of the band on stage getting ready for a song, and some subtle crowd walla as well.  There is plenty to play with if you need to loop.\r\n\r\nYou may here some bits of the MC or sax player in the background near the end,  but nothing you can't work around if you need to.\r\n\r\nCheck my other up-loads for an extended walla track from this same show.\r\n\r\nHope this track works out for you!",

There are some alternative arrangements of the layers, scooted around in time, to make some variation, which would help realism, if the sounds needed to be played back to back, like 3 rounds of applause in a row.  These are the \u201cstaggered\u201d files.\n\nThese were recorded in a medium size hall, with AKG C414\u2019s for the front left and right channels, and Neumann KM184\u2019s for the rear left and right channels.",

These were recorded in quad, with the design to be played out of four speakers, one near each corner of the room.  We made them with a small group of people, and recorded 20 layers or so of each reaction, moving the group around the room.  There are some alternative arrangements of the layers, scooted around in time, to make some variation, which would help realism, if the sounds needed to be played back to back, like 3 rounds of applause in a row.  These are the \u201cstaggered\u201d files.\n\nThese were recorded in a medium size hall, with AKG C414\u2019s for the front left and right channels, and Neumann KM184\u2019s for the rear left and right channels.",

I sat on the shoreline and hit record.\n\nAlso, binaural sound effect quality is greatly improved if you download the sample instead of streaming it. \n\nIf you want the original unedited .WAV then just ask. Comments would be appreciated! Thanks.",

It's my joy to create and share this musical journey with you!\n\nPlease, Subscribe to my Telegram channel:\n<a href=\"https://t.me/audiocoffeemusic\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://bit.ly/tfreesound</a>\nThere will be many new tracks and useful links.\n\nPlease credit me in your video description as follows:\nMusic by AudioCoffee: <a href=\"https://www.audiocoffee.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.audiocoffee.net/</a>\n\nThank you in advance! Wishing you great success on your projects!",

The high-pitched background noise is thousands of cicadas singing in the woods. The loud buzzing noises are individual cicadas who got pissed off when we picked them up (no cicadas were harmed). This is Brood II, which emerges along the eastern seaboard once every 17 years--1996, 2013, etc. Recorded with a Zoom H2 on June 22, 2013. ",

You hear the rumor from the crowd as a background of the market one Saturday morning and the noise of machinery and equipment used by the merchants. Several people passing by the seafood store are surprised because many animals are alive. Talks are in different languages because it is full of tourists. There is a group of musicians, oh, oh! They almost cannot walk among the people, but they laugh, sing and bring a hat to see if people put some coins. Recorded with a Sony PCM-D50 and microphones built.
