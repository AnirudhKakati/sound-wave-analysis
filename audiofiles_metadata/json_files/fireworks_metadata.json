Here is a recording from the day before independence day (yesterday) as people were blowing up part of their arsenal ahead of time.\r\n\r\nIn a few hours I will be recording as things get really crazy.  Our neighbors on three sides will light off the thousands of dollars of fireworks that they have purchased.  Many of them are illegal (purchased from Indian Reservations) so there will be some BIG booms.\r\n\r\nBack to this recording.  It is recorded with my \"fake head\" binaural setup, hanging from a tripod at the crest of the garage roof.  There is a tree a few feet away and a light breeze is rustling the leaves.  Here is a bit of  a timeline:\r\n\r\n0:00 Kids across the street light off a few fireworks\r\n4:05 The neighbors across the street were having a party, and the guests begin to leave.\r\n6:30 The guest of honor honks and yells \"Love You\" as she drives away.\r\n8:00 The kids across the street go inside.  Now all you hear are fireworks in the distance, all over town.\r\n32:17 Someone lights what must be a million firecrackers.  They continue until 51:20 - 19 minutes!!!\r\n",

I put my binaural recording setup on the crest of the roof of our 2 story house at 9PM and let it run until 11:30PM.\r\n\r\nThe neighbors to the NW and West of us were both having parties (the binaural \"head\" is facing SW).  The West neighbors had music blasting from 0:00:00 to 0:50:00.  People are blowing stuff up all over town, so there is a constant background of explosions.\r\n\r\nNormally the entire neighborhood gathers directly in front of our house, but this year some people were gone and the remaining people moved a few houses down.  So it was not as overpowering as it usually is.  Also at about 10PM the NW neighbors apparently moved to the north side of their house to finish lighting off their arsenal, so at about 1:00:00 the booms get a bit more distant.\r\n\r\nAlso at 1:00:00 you hear a fire truck in the distance.  There is always someone that ends up lighting something on fire.\r\n\r\nAt 1:05:00 the wind picks up so you hear the rustling of tree leaves.\r\n\r\nAt 2:28:00 a neighbor fires up his Harley and rides away.\r\n\r\nThe WAV is 1.7GB, too big to upload so if you want a particular segment let me know in the comments and I can upload a WAV.",

You can also hear the sounds of conversations in the crowd, screams of children, the sounds of a burning fire.On November 5 this year people across the UK light bonfires, let off fireworks, and burn effigies of a man named Guy Fawkes. The reason we do this is because it\u2019s the anniversary of the Gunpowder Plot (1605); a failed attempt to blow up the Houses of Parliament in London by a group of dissident Catholics.",

All of the water from Lake Michigan, Lake Superior &amp; Lake Huron flow through the St. Clair River before getting to the other 2 great lakes, then eventually the Atlantic Ocean. The Fireworks were discharged from a barge in the shipping channel that separates the USA and Canada. At the beginning of the recording the crowd is asked to do a count down, so the people of the barge know when to light off the fireworks.\n\nBeside crowd ambience, you here traffic from the road next to the park and some muffled music coming from the festival at St. Clair Mall on the other side of the highway behind the park. \n\nRecorded on 7-4-2022 in Saint Clair, Michigan.\nZoom H1n.\n\nDid a black screen video with this recording on my youtube channel. \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fw82tTIXs_E\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fw82tTIXs_E</a>",

        "description": "Yesterday evening was 5th November \u2014 generally known here in the UK, or at least England, as Bonfire or Guy Fawkes' Night. I won't go into the historical background, but this is our big excuse to go crazy with fireworks.\n\nSo, just as for my thunderstorm recordings, I recorded this from my bedroom window sill, the weather being clement enough then for me to open the window as far as it would go. As for thunderstorm recordings, I had the recording level on the Sony PCM-D100 set low (between 3 and 4 on the adjustment knob) to ensure any 'close encounters' didn't get clipped.\n\nThe dynamic range is big, so for a useful listening level you need to boost the playing volume by a whacking 15 dB \u2014 or, if you don't have a volume level scale in dB on your player, you need to be able to hear the background sound (very quiet) after the 1-second fade-in at the beginning.\n\nWhat I love about the sound of these firework panoramas I pick up is not so much the pops and bangs in themselves (soon boring as hell!), but the huge variation in nuances of their echos and reverberations. Generally, depending on exact location, each sound has multiple echoes, off different buildings, so the pops and bangs from each specific location have a different echo / reverb profile to those from any other location, and that profile would vary somewhat too according to their height.\n\nIn this recording the real fun starts late, towards an hour in, and then almost to the end. The firework activity in my facing direction (SW) gives way to one or more major firework displays some distance away on the other side of my abode (i.e., the NE side). That means that the directly heard sounds are low-level and of subdued tone, but their echoes on the buildings on this side are stronger \u2014 and each of those bangs has multiple echoes. When those are coming in quick succession, the echo effects are really weird and rather disorienting. At least, for this simple monkey, this is a really enjoyable entertainment, at least once in a long while.\n\nHowever, give me a thunderstorm any day rather than the environmental cost of all that fireworkery! <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\">\n<p><b>Please remember to give this recording a rating! <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.broad-horizon-nature.co.uk/me-icon_wink.gif\"></b>\n</p>",

Snow on top of the modern castle, were my friend live. I'm standing on top of the roof, 12 meters high above the fields. Snow is melting and going trough the drain into the castle-moat. \r\nAl kind of birds are there. Kids around having fun. \r\n\r\nLocation;\r\nThe modern apartment castle is positioned 600m from the river Maas (Maes). Opposite the river the village Hedel, Ammerzoden and Well, close the hamlet Bokhoven. The Netherlands (Holland), Europe.\r\n\r\nDate/time: December 30th 2014, 6.42-10 pm\r\nseason; winter-day\r\nweather: temp 3c, wind 1-3 bft SE, \r\nMic; NW 12 m high.\r\n\r\nGear chain: Rode NT4 XY (fore sides left and right) and a Rode NTG-1 shotgun (for mid-signal) in Rode Blimp > Sound Devices 302 (coder for <b>MS-recording</b> >Tascam dr-100 Mk2.\r\nThis strange MS-setup is developed by me to make it possible to make wide stereo recordings on a distance. \r\nThis is a MS (mid-side)-recording is encoded in STEREO Left-Right, so you can encode it to MONO without losing quality of sound.\r\n\r\nThis is a modern high quality -q10 (1500kbps) OGG Vobis compression file (48000Hz/16bit). The quality is almost as good  as the 48/24-WAV original file. You can easily use this file in HD-film and HIFI music-tracks. The sound-quality is, after this compression technique is still very high. The file size reduction is about 75% of the 2304kbps WAV-track\r\n\r\nWhen you use this sound it would be nice if you spent a voluntarily donation to freesound.  \r\n<b>YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO CREDIT/ATTRIBUTE</b> me (klankbeeld) and freesound.org in your work if you use this sound.",

(take 2)\nI made this recording during the 2024 French national holiday evening, from my balcony, located in a calm suburb of Paris, France. \nFirst, one can hear the street atmosphere, with some people and vehicles passing by from time to time, and fireworks exploding in the distance. In my opinion, these distant explosion could also match the background of a war scene. Then, at about #7:50, one can also hear clearly the French National Anthem broadcasted in some distant loud speakers. \nRecorded in July 2024 with an Olympus LS-P4 and Immersive Soundscapes EarSight microphones in AB position (about 40 cm). \nFade in/out and high pass filter at 60Hz -6dB/oct applied in Audacity. \n(If you want to use this sound as a mono audio file, you may have to delete one channel to avoid phase issues).",

        "description": "Fireworks- recording fireworks is really strange. There are two distinct things going on with fireworks- the sound of the explosion, and the powerful physical impact our bodies feel when all that sound energy reaches us. Thing is, the mics don\u2019t have any way of capturing that physical impact; they can only record the pop sound of the initial explosion. So what ends up on tape? Honestly, it doesn\u2019t sound much different than popping popcorn in your kitchen. Even with my good mics, I think I had to boost the low end a little bit in this recording to make it actually sound more like fireworks than popcorn. But judge for yourself.\r\n\r\nNady stereo condenser microphone\r\nFocusrite Saffire Pro24 interface\r\nLogic 8 on a MacBook Pro\r\n4th of July fireworks over Mission Bay, SanDiego",

This is not an official fireworks display, just a lot of people in a suburban neighborhood in southeast Portland, Oregon. Mostly just various explosions but from time to time you can hear some kids and some traffic.\r\nRecorded with a pair of Sound Professional binaural mics (MS-TFB-2) in a blimp, into a modified Marantz PMD661.\r\n**WARNING** this sound is in .FLAC format, so if you can't learn how to use this format, please don't download this sound, it is too dangerous.",

The Eiffel Tower is at about 1 mile away right in front of me, on the left bank of the river. It\u2019s lights are shining, then the fireworks start (on the tower and on the right side of the river too), and here is what you can hear : \nAll around, thousands of people are watching and reacting, as fireworks and explosions are impressive. On the left, a photographer takes pictures. In the background, walla from the crowd, engines and some horns from vehicles moving slowly on the bridge in my back, some music from the surroundings (restaurants, boats, and phone), police siren at times... \nAt about 18\u201900\u2019\u2019, the final fireworks will start, and at about 19\u201930\u2019\u2019, the crowd become really enthusiastic ! \nRecorded in July 2023 with an Olympus LS-P4 and Ohrwurm 3D binaural microphones. \nFade in/out and high pass filter at 60Hz -6dB/oct applied in Audacity. \n(If you want to use this sound as a mono audio file, you may have to delete one channel to avoid phase issues).",

All surface to air fireworks are illegal but, due to COVID-19 cabin fever, people just didn't care this year.\n\nThis recording is almost 99% voice free.  There was a couple on a balcony that are barely heard muttering something in just a minute or two of this recording.  For the most part, it's clean.\n\nI kept the peaks very low to maintain a natural sound.\n\nAll of my sounds recordings are provided free of all charges.
