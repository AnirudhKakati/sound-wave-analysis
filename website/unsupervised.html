                Unsupervised learning algorithms identify patterns and relationships in data without predefined labels or outcomes. This section explores three key unsupervised techniques applied to the audio dataset: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, Clustering for grouping similar sounds, and Association Rule Mining (ARM) for discovering relationships between audio features.

            <h2>Principal Component Analysis (PCA)</h2>
            <p class="text-justified">
                Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms a dataset with potentially correlated variables into a set of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components. These components are ordered by the amount of variance they explain in the original data, with the first component capturing the most variance. PCA helps us overcome the "curse of dimensionality," allowing for more efficient data visualization, pattern recognition, and computational processing while preserving the essential information in the data. The technique works by identifying the directions (principal components) where the data varies the most, projecting the data onto these new axes.

                        This diagram illustrates how PCA transforms high-dimensional data by projecting it onto new axes (principal components) that maximize variance. The first principal component (PC1) captures the direction of maximum variance, while subsequent components (PC2, PC3, etc.) capture remaining variance in orthogonal directions.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p class="text-justified">
                Understanding variance is key to PCA. In statistical terms, variance measures how spread out data points are from their mean. PCA finds the directions where the data varies the most, which typically contain the most important information. The first principal component points in the direction of maximum variance, essentially capturing the strongest pattern in the data. Each subsequent component is orthogonal (perpendicular) to the previous ones and captures the maximum remaining variance.
            </p>
            
            <p class="text-justified">
                When we reduce dimensions using PCA, we can quantify how much information we retain through the "explained variance ratio" of each component. This tells us what percentage of the original data's variance is preserved by each principal component. Typically, we might keep enough components to retain 80-95% of the total variance, striking a balance between dimensionality reduction and information preservation.

                PCA helped transform the numerous sound features into a smaller set of principal components that captured the essential patterns in the data. This revealed which combinations of sound characteristics were most important for distinguishing between different audio categories, eliminated redundant information, and made visualization and classification more effective.

                Before applying PCA, we needed to prepare the data by removing non-numeric features (category and filepath) and standardizing the remaining features. Standardization is crucial for PCA as it ensures that features with larger scales don't dominate the variance calculation. We used scikit-learn's StandardScaler to transform each feature to have zero mean and unit variance.

                PCA has proven to be an invaluable tool for audio data analysis, allowing the reduction of the 43-dimensional feature space to a more manageable representation while preserving essential patterns. The 2D and 3D visualizations reveal natural groupings among sound categories that align with intuitive understanding of acoustic similarities. For instance, musical instruments cluster together, as do mechanical sounds and animal vocalizations. Moreover, PCA has prepared the data for more efficient clustering analysis by eliminating redundant information and noise. By focusing on the 26 principal components that capture 95% of the variance, the analysis can proceed with more computationally efficient and interpretable techniques while still retaining the most meaningful aspects of the sound features. 
                For the sake of simplicity and visual clarity in the following sections, only 3 principal components are considered.

                Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique that groups similar data points together based on their inherent patterns and relationships, without predefined labels. The goal is to organize data into clusters where items within a cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters. This similarity is typically measured using distance metrics such as Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, or cosine similarity, which quantify how "close" data points are in the feature space.

                Distance metrics are fundamental to clustering algorithms as they define what "similarity" means in the context of the data. Euclidean distance, the most common metric, measures the straight-line distance between points in Euclidean space. Manhattan distance sums the absolute differences of coordinates, making it useful when features represent discrete steps. Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between vectors, focusing on orientation rather than magnitude, which is particularly useful for high-dimensional data where the magnitude might be less important than the pattern of features.

K-means (centre) partitions the space into Voronoi cells, with each point assigned to the nearest centroid. Hierarchical clustering (right) builds a tree-like structure of nested clusters. DBSCAN (left) identifies dense regions separated by sparser areas, capable of finding arbitrary-shaped clusters and identifying outliers.

                        Hierarchical clustering builds a tree of nested clusters by either merging (agglomerative) or splitting (divisive) groups. It doesn't require pre-specifying the number of clusters and provides a dendrogram visualization of the clustering process. However, it can be computationally intensive for large datasets and requires choosing a linkage method (e.g., Ward's, complete, single) that defines how distances between clusters are measured.

                    DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) identifies clusters as dense regions separated by sparser areas. It doesn't require specifying the number of clusters and can discover arbitrarily shaped clusters while identifying outliers as noise. However, it's sensitive to its parameters (epsilon and min_samples) and struggles with clusters of varying densities. DBSCAN is particularly useful for datasets with noise and non-spherical cluster shapes.

                For the clustering analysis, the 3D PCA-transformed dataset created in the previous section will be used. This approach offers two significant advantages: it reduces computational complexity by working with just three dimensions instead of the original 43, and it focuses on the most significant variance in the data, potentially leading to more meaningful clusters. The dataset maintains the category labels, allowing for evaluation of how well the clustering results align with the actual sound categories.            </p>

                In conclusion, this clustering analysis provides valuable insights into the natural organization of sound categories based on their acoustic properties. The results could inform the development of automatic sound classification systems by highlighting which categories are inherently similar and which are acoustically distinct. For instance, a hierarchical approach to classification might first distinguish between tonal and non-tonal sounds before making finer distinctions. Additionally, clustering helps explain why certain sound categories might be commonly confused in classification tasks, as they occupy similar regions in the acoustic feature space. These insights can guide feature engineering and model selection for supervised learning tasks in audio processing.

                Association Rule Mining (ARM) is a technique used to discover interesting relationships between variables in large datasets. Unlike clustering, which groups similar items together, ARM identifies specific patterns of co-occurrence, answering questions like "What features frequently appear together?" or "If feature A has a high value, what can we predict about feature B?"

                        This diagram illustrates the concept of association rules. Rules take the form "If antecedent, then consequent" (A → B), indicating that when A occurs, B also tends to occur. In our audio analysis, this might be "If the zero-crossing rate is high and the spectral centroid is high, then the sound is likely a bird vocalization."

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Support:</strong> The proportion of transactions (samples) that contain both the antecedent and consequent. Support measures how frequently a rule appears in the dataset.</li>
                <li><strong>Confidence:</strong> The likelihood that the consequent occurs when the antecedent occurs. Confidence is calculated as the support of the entire rule divided by the support of the antecedent.</li>
                <li><strong>Lift:</strong> A measure of how much more likely the consequent is when the antecedent occurs, compared to the consequent's overall frequency. Lift values greater than 1 indicate positive association, with higher values suggesting stronger relationships.</li>

Strong rules have high values for all three metrics.

                The Apriori algorithm is one of the most widely used methods for mining association rules. It works by first identifying frequent itemsets (sets of items that appear together frequently) and then generating rules from these itemsets. The algorithm uses a "bottom-up" approach, extending one item at a time and testing the frequency of each candidate itemset against a minimum support threshold.

                In our audio analysis, ARM can reveal which acoustic features tend to co-occur and how they relate to sound categories. For instance, we can discover that specific combinations of spectral and temporal features strongly associate with particular sound types, providing interpretable insights into what makes different sounds acoustically distinctive.

            <p class="text-justified">
                ARM traditionally works with binary or categorical data, where items either appear in a transaction or don't. Our audio dataset, however, contains continuous numerical features. To apply ARM, we needed to transform these continuous values into categorical bins.
            </p>
            
            <p class="text-justified">
                We started by taking a representative subset of our data, selecting 100 samples from each of the 20 sound categories for a total of 2,000 samples. From the original 43 features, we selected 15 key acoustic features based on their importance in our PCA analysis:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>MFCC features (mfcc_1, mfcc_2, mfcc_4)</li>
                <li>Chroma features (chroma_3, chroma_7)</li>
                <li>Spectral contrast features (spectral_contrast_1, spectral_contrast_3)</li>
                <li>Basic audio descriptors (zero_crossing_rate, spectral_centroid, spectral_bandwidth, rms_energy, spectral_rolloff)</li>
                <li>Tonal features (tonnetz_1, tonnetz_3, tonnetz_6)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p class="text-justified">
                To discretize these continuous features, we applied a simple but effective three-bin strategy:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Values below the 33rd percentile were labeled as "low"</li>
                <li>Values between the 33rd and 67th percentiles were labeled as "medium"</li>
                <li>Values above the 67th percentile were labeled as "high"</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p class="text-justified">
                This transformation converted our continuous features into categorical features suitable for ARM analysis.

                        Rules with high confidence are highly reliable predictors. When the antecedent occurs, the consequent follows with high probability. These rules reveal that certain feature combinations can strongly predict other acoustic properties, such as how MFCC patterns reliably predict spectral characteristics in speech sounds.

                Association Rule Mining has provided valuable insights into the acoustic characteristics that define different sound categories. The discovered rules reveal the distinctive feature combinations that characterize various sounds in our everyday environment. For example, bird sounds are characterized by high-frequency content (high spectral centroid) and rapid signal changes (high zero-crossing rate), while thunder sounds combine low-frequency content with high energy levels.
            </p>
            
            <p class="text-justified">
                These association rules give us an interpretable understanding of what makes different sounds unique, complementing the holistic groupings provided by clustering. While clustering showed us which sounds are similar overall, ARM reveals exactly which feature combinations make them distinctive. This knowledge has practical applications in sound recognition, audio synthesis, and acoustic monitoring systems.
            </p>
            
            <p class="text-justified">
                Moreover, the rules discovered through ARM can inform feature selection for supervised learning models, highlighting which acoustic properties are most informative for distinguishing between sound categories. By focusing on the most distinctive feature combinations identified through ARM, we can build more efficient and accurate sound classification systems.
