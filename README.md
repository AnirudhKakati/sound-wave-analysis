## Requirements

- **Python 3.11.6**  
  It is recommended to use Python 3.10 or 3.11, as some libraries used may not fully support Python versions 3.12 and above.  
  [Download Python 3.11.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3116/)

- **FFmpeg**  
  Required for audio conversion.  
  [Download FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)

- **Install all required libraries:**
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

- **Additional:**  
  A `.env` file is required containing the Freesound API key.

## How to Run

Before starting, ensure:
- Python 3.10/3.11 is installed.
- FFmpeg is installed and working.
- Dependencies are installed via `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Freesound API key is set up in `.env` file.


### Step 1: Metadata Collection
Fetch metadata for different sound categories from Freesound API.
```bash
python scripts/getting_metadata.py
```

### Step 2: Audio File Download
Download audio files based on collected metadata.
```bash
python scripts/getting_audiofiles.py
```

### Step 3: Audio Preprocessing
Convert `.mp3` files to `.wav`, standardize sampling rate, length, and normalize.
```bash
python scripts/preprocessing_audiofiles.py
```

### Step 4: Feature Extraction
Extract features like MFCCs, Chroma, Spectral features, etc.
```bash
python scripts/extracting_audio_features.py
```

### Step 5: Data Visualization
Generate plots like MFCC radial plots, spectral features, RMS energy graphs.
```bash
python scripts/visualizations.py
```
